abstract = {We show useful seasonal deterministic and probabilistic prediction skill of streamflow and nutrient loading over watersheds in the Southeastern United States (SEUS) for the winter and spring seasons. The study accounts for forecast uncertainties stemming from the meteorological forcing and hydrological model uncertainty. Multi-model estimation from three hydrological models, each forced with an ensemble of forcing derived by matching observed analogues of forecasted quartile rainfall anomalies from a seasonal climate forecast is used. The attained useful hydrological prediction skill is despite the climate model overestimating rainfall by over 23{\%} over these SEUS watersheds in December-May period. The prediction skill in the month of April and May is deteriorated as compared to the period from December-March (zero lead forecast). A nutrient streamflow rating curve is developed using a log linear tool for this purpose. The skill in the prediction of seasonal nutrient loading is identical to the skill of seasonal streamflow forecast.},

abstract = {Grain-boundary thickness in polycrystalline ice is a function of time (age), salinity, tempera-turf {\textperiodcentered}, and mode of sample preparation. It is directly proportional to the salinity of the ice and the number-average grain diameter (spheres) or edge-length (cubes). Practically the total salt content resides in the grain boundary for low salinity ice samples. The gram-boundary thickness S is also directly proportional to growth time of the grains raised to a power n(n = 0.25 to 0.3) and increases exponentially with absolute temperature for constant salinity and age. The energy of activation for growth increases with salinity. The results of the grain-boundary thickness calculations are useful for evaluating grain-boundary diffusion coefficients.},

abstract = {Modeling snow hydrology for cold regions remains a problematic aspect of many hydro-environmental models. Temperature-index methods are commonly used and are routinely justified under the auspices that process-based models require too many input data. To test this claim, we used a physical, process-based model to simulate snowmelt at four locations across the conterminous US using energy components estimated from measured daily maximum and minimum temperature, i.e. using only the same data required for temperature-index models. The results showed good agreement between observed and predicted snow water equivalents, average R2{\textgreater}0.9. We duplicated the simulations using a simple temperature-index model best fitted to the data and results were poorer, R2{\textless}0.8. At one site we applied the process-based model without substantial parameter estimation, and there were no significant ($\alpha$=0.05) differences between these results and those obtained using temperature-estimated parameters, despite relatively poorly predicted specific energy budget components (R2{\textless}0.8). These results encourage the use of mechanistic snowmelt modeling approaches in hydrological models, especially in distributed hydrological models for which landscape snow distribution may be controlled by spatially distributed components of the environmental energy budget.},

The freezing process is commonly implicated as a key factor in defining the state of soil structural stability following the winter months. Controversy exists, however, regarding the efficacy, and even the net effect, of this process. The objective of the study was to establish the separate effects of the freezing, freeze–thaw and freeze-drying processes in defining soil structural stability following the over-winter period. Aggregates from soils of varying clay content (0.11, 0.33, 0.44 kg kg−1) and initial water content (0.10, 0.20 or 0.30 kg kg−1) were subjected to freeze-only (F), freeze–thaw (FT) and freeze-dry (FD) treatments. Post-treatment aggregate stability determination was via wet aggregate stability (WAS) and dispersible clay (DC). Freezing alone and freeze-dry treatments generally resulted in greater aggregate stability, while the freeze–thaw generally resulted in lower aggregate...},

abstract = {Field-scale relationships between soil test phosphorus (STP) and flow-weighted mean concentrations (FWMCs) of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and total phosphorus (TP) in runoff are essential for modeling phosphorus losses, but are lacking. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the relationships between soil phosphorus (STP and degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS)) and runoff phosphorus (TP and DRP) from field-sized catchments under spring snowmelt and summer rainfall conditions, and (ii) to determine whether a variety of depths and spatial representations of STP improved the prediction of phosphorus losses. Runoff was monitored from eight field-scale microwatersheds (2 to 248 ha) for 3 yr. Soil test phosphorus was determined for three layers (0 to 2.5 cm, 0 to 5 cm, and 0 to 15 cm) in spring and fall and the DPS was determined for the surface layer. Average STP (0 to 15 cm) ranged from 3 to 512 mg kg(-1), and DPS (0 to 2.5 cm) ranged from 5 to 91{\%}. Seasonal FWMCs ranged from 0.01 to 7.4 mg L(-1) DRP and from 0.1 to 8.0 mg L(-1) TP. Strong linear relationships (r2=0.87 to 0.89) were found between the site mean STP and the FWMCs of DRP and TP. The relationships had similar extraction coefficients, intercepts, and predictive power among all three soil layers. Extraction coefficients (0.013 to 0.014) were similar to those reported for other Alberta studies, but were greater than those reported for rainfall simulation studies. The curvilinear DPS relationship showed similar predictive ability to STP. The field-scale STP relationships derived from natural conditions in this study should provide the basis for modeling phosphorus in Alberta.},

abstract = {Geographically isolated wetlands (GIW), depressional landscape features entirely surrounded by upland areas, provide a wide range of ecological functions and ecosystem services for human well-being. Current and future ecosystem management and decision-making rely on a solid scientific understanding of how hydrologic processes affect these important GIW services and functions, and in turn on how GIWs affect downstream surface water systems. Consequently, quantifying the hydrologic connectivity of GIWs to other surface water systems (including streams, rivers, lakes, and other navigable waters) and the processes governing hydrologic connectivity of GIWs at a variety of watershed scales has become an important topic for the scientific and decision-making communities. We review examples of potential mechanistic modeling tools that could be applied to further advance scientific understanding concerning: (1) The extent to which hydrologic connections between GIWs and other surface waters exist, and (2) How these connections affect downstream hydrology at the scale of watersheds. Different modeling approaches involve a variety of domain and process conceptualizations, and numerical approximations for GIW-related questions. We describe select models that require only limited modifications to model the interaction of GIWs and other surface waters. We suggest that coupled surface–subsurface approaches exhibit the most promise for characterizing GIW connectivity under a variety of flow conditions, though we note their complexity and the high level of modeling expertise required to produce reasonable results. We also highlight empirical techniques that will inform mechanistic models that estimate hydrologic connectivity of GIWs for research, policy, and management purposes. Developments in the related disciplines of remote sensing, hillslope and wetland hydrology, empirical modeling, and tracer studies will assist in advancing current mechanistic modeling approaches to most accurately elucidate connectivity of GIWs to other surface waters and the effects of GIWs on downstream systems at the watershed scale.},

abstract = {Increasing nutrient inputs into terrestrial ecosystems affect not only plant communities but also associated soil microbial communities. Studies carried out in predominantly unmanaged ecosystems have found that increasing nitrogen (N) inputs generally decrease soil microbial biomass; less is known about long-term impacts in managed systems such as agroecosystems. The objective of this paper was to analyze the responses of soil microorganisms to mineral fertilizer using data from long-term fertilization trials in cropping systems. A meta-analysis based on 107 datasets from 64 long-term trials from around the world revealed that mineral fertilizer application led to a 15.1{\%} increase in the microbial biomass (Cmic) above levels in unfertilized control treatments. Mineral fertilization also increased soil organic carbon (Corg) content and our results suggest that Corg is a major factor contributing to the overall increase in Cmic with mineral fertilization. The magnitude of the effect of fertilization on Cmic was pH dependent. While fertilization tended to reduce Cmic in soils with a pH below 5 in the fertilized treatment, it had a significantly positive effect at higher soil pH values. Duration of the trial also affected the response of Cmic to fertilization, with increases in Cmic most pronounced in studies with a duration of at least 20 years. The input of N per se does not seem to negatively affect Cmic in cropping systems. The application of urea and ammonia fertilizers, however, can temporarily increase pH, osmotic potential and ammonia concentrations to levels inhibitory to microbial communities. Even though impacts of fertilizers are spatially limited, they may strongly affect soil microbial biomass and community composition in the short term. Long-term repeated mineral N applications may alter microbial community composition even when pH changes are small. How specific microbial groups respond to repeated applications of mineral fertilizers, however, varies considerably and seems to depend on environmental and crop management related factors.},

Analyses of regional climate models (RCMs) based on future climate projections presented in a companion paper of this special issue (Dibike et al., 2012) show future increases in annual precipitation and temperature in various seasons and regions of this catchment. Such changes are expected to influence the volume of snow accumulation and melt, as well as the timing and intensity of runoff. This paper presents results of modelling climate-induced hydrologic changes in two representative sub-catchments of the Red and Assiniboine basins in the LWW. The hydrologic model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was employed to simulate a 21-year baseline (1980-2000) and future (2042-2062) climate based on climate forcings derived from 3 RCMs. The effects of future changes in climatic variables, specifically precipitation and temperature, are clearly evident in the resulting snowmelt and runoff regimes. The most significant changes include higher total runoff, and earlier snowmelt and discharge peaks. Some of the results also revealed increases in peak discharge intensities. Such changes will have significant implications for water availability and nutrient transport regimes in the LWW. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate and improve existing simple snow-cover models to pre-process weather data for improving simulations of soil temperature, soil moisture content, and crop growth under cold, humid continental climates using a crop model. Three snow-cover models were calibrated using readily available input data (minimum and maximum daily air temperature and precipitation) and were evaluated using several data sets from across eastern Canada. The snow-cover model providing the best validation results (model efficiency=0.89) was then used to pre-process climate data used to run the STICS crop model over 3 yr at two sites (Quebec City, QC, and Ottawa, ON). Three output variables (shoot biomass, soil temperature at two depths, and soil moisture content at two depths) were compared with field measurements when the STICS model was used with and without pre-processing of the weather data with the snow-cover model. When climate data were pre-processed with the snow-cover model, the performance of STICS in simulating soil temperature was significantly improved during the non-growing season (November–April). Model performance during the growing season (May–October) was thus similar to the model performance during the non-growing season, with a small bias ({\textless}0.5°C), a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 2°C, and a model efficiency higher than 0.93. The simulation of soil moisture with STICS also improved slightly with the use of the snow-cover model, but model performance was better in the 15-to-30-cm soil layer than in the 0-to-15-cm layer (RMSE of about 2vol.{\%} in the 15-to-30-cm layer versus 3.5vol.{\%} in the 0-to-15-cm layer). The prediction of plant shoot dry biomass (spring wheat and corn) with STICS was affected little by the use of the snow-cover model and was good with and without the snow-cover model (RMSE of 1.1tha−1). This study showed that STICS can run over several years in the eastern Canada pedo-climatic context without affecting model performance in predicting crop biomass and the two main soil variables. This result opens new opportunities for using STICS or other crop models under a northern climate characterized by a short growing season and significant snow cover during the non-growing season. This result also offers a foundation for future studies aimed at simulating the winter survival of perennial crops as well as annual water and nitrogen cycling in agricultural soils.},

abstract = {This book is based on the author's experience with calculations involving polynomial splines. It presents those parts of the theory which are especially useful in calculations and stresses the representation of splines as linear combinations of B-splines. After two chapters summarizing polynomial approximation, a rigorous discussion of elementary spline theory is given involving linear, cubic and parabolic splines. The computational handling of piecewise polynomial functions (of one variable) of arbitrary order is the subject of chapters VII and VIII, while chapters IX, X, and XI are devoted to B-splines. The distances from splines with fixed and with variable knots is discussed in chapter XII. The remaining five chapters concern specific approximation methods, interpolation, smoothing and least-squares approximation, the solution of an ordinary differential equation by collocation, curve fitting, and surface fitting. The present text version differs from the original in several respects. The book is now typeset (in plain TeX), the Fortran programs now make use of Fortran 77 features. The figures have been redrawn with the aid of Matlab, various errors have been corrected, and many more formal statements have been provided with proofs. Further, all formal statements and equations have been numbered by the same numbering system, to make it easier to find any particular item. A major change has occured in Chapters IX-XI where the B-spline theory is now developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This has brought in knot insertion as a powerful tool for providing simple proofs concerning the shape-preserving properties of the B-spline series.},

abstract = {The objective was to provide selection criteria for substrates that would enhance phosphate removal from waste water in a constructed wetland system (subsurface horizontal flow). Measured properties of seven substrates (bauxite, shale, burnt oil shale, limestone, zeolite, light expanded clay aggregates (LECA) and fly ash) were: pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), hydraulic conductivity, porosity, specific surface area, particle size distribution and phosphate (P) adsorption capacity. Fly ash and shale had the highest P adsorption values, followed by bauxite, limestone and LECA. Longer-term experiments in which synthetic waste water was passed over shale and bauxite gave maximum P uptake values of 730 and 355mg Pkg−1, respectively. X-ray fluorescence measurements showed that substantial precipitation of P had occurred on the shale surfaces. On the basis of these measurements it was concluded that, of the seven materials examined, shale had the best combination of properties as a substrate for constructed wetland systems (CWS).},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is the limiting nutrient responsible for the development of algal blooms in freshwater bodies, adversely impacting the water quality of downstream lakes and rivers. Since agriculture is a major non-point source of P in southern Quebec, this study was carried out to investigate P transport under subsurface and naturally drained agricultural fields with two common soil types (clay loam and sandy loam). Monitoring stations were installed at four sites (A, B, C and D) in the Pike River watershed of southern Quebec. Sites A–B had subsurface drainage whereas sites C–D were naturally drained. In addition, sites A–C had clay loam soils whereas sites B–D had sandy loam soils. Analysis of data acquired over two hydrologic years (2004–2006) revealed that site A discharged 1.8 times more water than site B, 4 times more than site C and 3 times more than site D. The presence of subsurface drainage in sandy loam soils had a significant beneficial effect in minimizing surface runoff and total phosphorus (TP) losses from the field, but the contrary was observed in clay loam soils. This was attributed to the finding that P speciation as particulate phosphorus (PP) and dissolved phosphorus (DP) remained relatively independent of the hydrologic transport pathway, and was a strong function of soil texture. While 80{\%} of TP occurred as PP at both clay loam sites, only 20{\%} occurred as PP at both sandy loam sites. Moreover, P transport pathways in artificially drained soils were greatly influenced by the prevailing preferential and macropore flow conditions.},

The freezing and thawing of soil in cold climates often produces large emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) that may contribute significantly to a soil's annual greenhouse gas emission budget. This review summarizes the state of knowledge of the physical and biological mechanisms that drive heightened N2O emissions at spring melt. Most studies of freeze–thaw N2O emissions have concluded that denitrification is the dominant process responsible for the large thaw fluxes. Soil moisture, availability of carbon and nitrogen substrates, and freeze temperature and duration are the major factors identified as controlling freeze–thaw cycle (FTC) N2O emissions. Two mechanisms are proposed to lead to enhanced N2O emissions at thaw: (1) the physical release of N2O that is produced throughout the winter and trapped under frozen surface layers and/or within ...},

abstract = {Winter climate change is an important environmental driver that alters the biogeochemical processes of forest soils. The decrease in snowpack amplifies soil freeze{\&}{\#}x2013;thaw cycles and decreases the snowmelt water supply to soil. This study examined how snow decrease affects nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification in forest soil in northern Japan by conducting an in situ experimental snowpack manipulation experiment and a laboratory incubation of soil with different moisture, temperature and freeze{\&}{\#}x2013;thaw magnitudes. For the incubation studies, surface mineral soil (0{\&}{\#}x2013;10 cm) was collected from a cool-temperate natural mixed forest and incubated using the resin core method during the winter. In the field, there were two treatments: 50 and 100 {\%} snow removal and control plots. The increase in the soil freeze{\&}{\#}x2013;thaw cycle increased net N mineralization and marginally decreased the net nitrification in soil. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and DOC/DON ratio in soil increased with the decrease in snowpack especially during the snow melt period. These results suggested that the change in substrate quality by the increase in freeze{\&}{\#}x2013;thaw cycles caused the significant enhancement of microbial ammonium production in soil. The lower soil moisture and higher gross immobilization of inorganic N by soil microbes may be maintaining the slow net nitrification and low nitrate leaching in freeze{\&}{\#}x2013;thaw cycles with less snowpack. The results indicate that winter climate change would strongly impact N biogeochemistry through the increase in ammonium availability in soil for plants and microbes, whereas it would be unlikely that nitrate loss from surface soil would be enhanced.},

A case study of the River Kennet illustrates how the system can be used to investigate aspects of climate change uncertainty, deployable water resources, and water quality dynamics in upper and lower reaches of the drainage network. The results confirm the large uncertainty in climate change scenarios and freshwater impacts due to the choice of general circulation model (GCM). This uncertainty is shown to be greatest during summer months as evidenced by large variations between GCM-derived projections of future low river flows, deployable yield from groundwater, severity of nutrient flushing episodes, and long-term trends in surface water quality. Other impacts arising from agricultural land-use reform or delivery of EU Water Framework Directive objectives under climate change could be evaluated using the same framework. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Waiser2011,
abstract = {Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada (population 190,400) treats its sewage at a modern sewage treatment plant (STP) on Wascana Creek. In the winter, treated sewage effluent makes up almost 100{\%} of stream flow. Four surveys conducted from 2005 to 2007, in differing seasons, indicated significantly higher nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations at sites downstream of the STP compared to an upstream control site. Downstream, Wascana Creek is N hypersaturated (total dissolved N {\textgreater}3 mg/L) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) makes up a greater percentage of total P (TP). Diminished nutrient retention capacities for both N and P are directly attributable to STP effluent. Creek SRP concentrations are less than estimates of equilibrium P concentrations (EPC(o)), indicating that creek sediments may be a source of P, further exacerbating hypereutrophic ambient SRP concentrations. As well, NO(2) + NO(3)-N concentrations far surpass World Health Organization limits for drinking water (10 mg/L) and sensitive taxa, while NH(3)-N, NH(4)-N, and NO(2) + NO(3)-N exceed Canadian Water Quality Guidelines for Protection of Aquatic Life and those for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. High NH(4)-N concentrations may be responsible for depressions not only in algal biomass and production observed downstream but reductions in primary to bacterial production ratios (PP:BP). In spring and fall, these reductions push PP:BP from net autotrophy to heterotrophy. The Wascana Creek study highlights the considerable problems associated with excess nutrients in effluent-dominated ecosystems (EDS). It also underlines the need for better controls on NH(4)-N additions from STPs in such EDS, especially in a day and age when freshwater supplies are dwindling and negative effects of climate change are expected.},

abstract = {Following a development similar to that used by Penman (1948) a general combination equation is derived to describe evaporation from nonsaturated surfaces. To account for departure from saturated conditions, the equation makes use of the concept of relative evaporation, the ratio of the actual to the potential evaporation, defined here as the evaporation rate which would occur under the existing atmospheric conditions if the surface were saturated at the actual surface temperature. A relationship is established between the relative evaporation and a dimensionless parameter called the relative drying power, the ratio of the drying power to the sum of the drying power and the net available energy (net radiation plus soil heat flux). The relationship is nondimensional and appears to be single-valued. The combination of this relationship with the general evaporation equation derived constitutes a simple model for obtaining estimates of evaporation from nonsaturated surfaces; no prior estimate of the potential evaporation is required, and the surface conditions of temperature and humidity need not be known. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {The numerical formulation of a one-dimensional physical snowpack model is presented. The model is operationally employed on a day-to-day basis by avalanche warners to predict snowpack settlement, layering, surface energy exchange and mass balance. Meteorological data obtained from automatic weather stations positioned near avalanche starting zones is used as model input. In this paper, the one-dimensional equations governing the heat transfer, water transport, vapour diffusion and mechanical deformation of a phase changing snowpack are stated. New snow, wind drift and snow ablation are treated as special mass boundary conditions. Snow is modelled as a three-component (ice, water, air) porous material capable of undergoing large irreversible viscous deformations. Phase changes between the components are simulated. Snow layers are defined not only in terms of height and density, but also microstructure. That is, by the size, shape and bonding of the grains composing the ice lattice. The governing differential equations are solved using a fully implicit Lagrangian Gauss–Seidel finite-element method. Example calculations from the catastrophic avalanche winter 1999 are presented to document model performance. The overall mass balance evaluation shows that the model accurately predicts the build-up and ablation of the seasonal alpine snowcover.},

abstract = {Snowmelt hydrology is a very important component for applying SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) in watersheds where the stream flows in spring are predominantly generated from melting snow. However, there is a lack of information about the performance of this component because most published studies were conducted in rainfall-runoff dominant watersheds. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the SWAT model's snowmelt hydrology by simulating stream flows for the Wild Rice River watershed, located in northwestern Minnesota. Along with the three snowmelt-related parameters determined to be sensitive for the simulation (snowmelt temperature, maximum snowmelt factor, and snowpack temperature lag factor), eight additional parameters (surface runoff lag coefficient, Muskingum translation coefficients for normal and low flows, SCS curve number, threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur, groundwater "revap" coefficient, threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer for "revap" or percolation to the deep aquifer to occur, and soil evaporation compensation factor) were adjusted using the PEST (Parameter ESTimation) software. Subsequently, the PEST-determined values for these parameters were manually adjusted to further refine the model. In addition to two commonly used statistics (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, and coefficient of determination), a measure designated "performance virtue" was developed and used to evaluate the model. This evaluation indicated that for the study watershed, the SWAT model had a good performance on simulating the monthly, seasonal, and annual mean discharges and a satisfactory performance on predicting the daily discharges. When analyzed alone, the daily stream flows in spring, which were predominantly generated from melting snow, could be predicted with an acceptable accuracy, and the corresponding monthly and seasonal mean discharges could be simulated very well. Further, the model had an overall better performance for evaluation years with a larger snowpack than for those with a smaller snowpack, and tended to perform relatively better for one of the stations tested than for the other.},

@article{McLauchlan2006,
abstract = {Since the domestication of plant and animal species around 10,000 years ago, cultivation and animal husbandry have been major components of global change. Agricultural activities such as tillage, fertilization, and biomass alteration lead to fundamental changes in the pools and fluxes of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) that originally existed in native ecosystems. Land is often taken out of agricultural production for economic, social, or biological reasons, and the ability to predict the biogeochemical trajectory of this land is important to our understanding of ecosystem development and our projections of food security for the future. Tillage generally decreases soil organic matter (SOM) due to erosion and disruption of the physical, biochemical, and chemical mechanisms of SOM stabilization, but SOM can generally reaccumulate after the cessation of cultivation. The use of organic amendments causes increases in SOM on agricultural fields that can last for centuries to millennia after the termination of applications, although the locations that provide the organic amendments are concurrently depleted. The legacy of agriculture is therefore highly variable on decadal to millennial time scales and depends on the specific management practices that are followed during the agricultural period. State factors such as climate and parent material (particularly clay content and mineralogy) modify ecosystem processes such that they may be useful predictors of rates of postagricultural biogeochemical change. In addition to accurate biogeochemical budgets of postagricultural systems, ecosystem models that more explicitly incorporate mechanisms of SOM loss and formation with agricultural practices will be helpful. Developing this predictive capacity will aid in ecological restoration efforts and improve the management of modern agroecosystems as demands on agriculture become more pressing.},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) in runoff from landscapes can promote eutrophication of natural waters. Soluble P released from plant material can contribute significant amounts of P to runoff particularly after plant freezing or drying. This study was conducted to evaluate P losses from alfalfa or grass after freezing or drying as potential contributors to runoff P. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and grass (principally, Agropyron repens L.) plant samples were subjected to freezing and drying treatments to determine P release. Simulated rainfall runoff and natural runoff from established alfalfa fields and a grass waterway were collected to study P contributions from plant tissue to runoff. The effects of freezing and drying on P released from plant tissue were simulated by a herbicide treatment in selected experiments. Soluble reactive P (SP) extracted from alfalfa and grass samples was markedly increased by freezing or drying. In general, SP extracted from plant samples increased in the order fresh {\textless} frozen {\textless} frozen/thawed {\textless} dried, and averaged 1, 8, 14, and 26{\%} of total P in alfalfa, respectively. Soluble reactive P extracted from alfalfa after freezing or drying increased with increasing soil test P (r(2) = 0.64 to 0.68), suggesting that excessive soil P levels increased the risk of plant P contributions to runoff losses. In simulated rainfall studies, paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4, 4''-bipyridinium ion) treatment of alfalfa increased P losses in runoff, and results suggested that this treatment simulated the effects of drying on plant P loss. In contrast to the simulated rainfall results, natural runoff studies over 2 yr did not show higher runoff P losses that could be attributed to P from alfalfa. Actual P losses likely depend on the timing and extent of plant freezing and drying and of precipitation events after freezing.},

abstract = {Experiments were conducted during 1993 at Niwot Ridge in the Colorado Front Range to determine if the insulating effect of winter snow cover allows soil microbial activity to significantly affect nitrogen inputs and outputs in alpine systems. Soil surface temperatures under seasonal snowpacks warmed from -14 °C in January to 0 °C by May 4th. Snowmelt began in mid-May and the sites were snow free by mid June. Heterotrophic microbial activity in snow-covered soils, measured as CO2 production, was first identified on March 4, 1993. Net CO2 flux increased from 55 mg CO2-C m-2 day-1 in early March to greater than 824 mg CO2-C m-2 day-1 by the middle of May. Carbon dioxide production decreased in late May as soils became saturated during snowmelt. Soil inorganic N concentrations increased before snowmelt, peaking between 101 and 276 mg kg-1 soil in May, and then decreasing as soils became saturated with melt water. Net N mineralization for the period of March 3 to May 4 ranged from 2.23 to 6.63 g N m-2, and were approximately two orders of magnitude greater than snowmelt inputs of 50.4 mg N m-2 for NH4+ and 97.2 mg N m-2 for NO3-. Both NO3- and NH4+ concentrations remained at or below detection limits in surface water during snowmelt, indicating the only export of inorganic N from the system was through gaseous losses. Nitrous oxide production under snow was first observed in early April. Production increased as soils warmed, peaking at 75 $\mu$g N2O-N m-2 day-1 in soils saturated with melt water one week before the sites were snow free. These data suggest that microbial activity in snow-covered soils may play a key role in alpine N cycling before plants become active.},

abstract = {The impacts of climate change on nitrogen (N) in a lowland chalk stream are investigated using a dynamic modelling approach. The INCA-N model is used to simulate transient daily hydrology and water quality in the River Kennet using temperature and precipitation scenarios downscaled from the General Circulation Model (GCM) output for the period 1961-2100. The three GCMs (CGCM2, CSIRO and HadCM3) yield very different river flow regimes with the latter projecting significant periods of drought in the second half of the 21st century. Stream-water N concentrations increase over time as higher temperatures enhance N release from the soil, and lower river flows reduce the dilution capacity of the river. Particular problems are shown to occur following severe droughts when N mineralization is high and the subsequent breaking of the drought releases high nitrate loads into the river system. Possible strategies for reducing climate-driven N loads are explored using INCA-N. The measures include land use change or fertiliser reduction, reduction in atmospheric nitrate and ammonium deposition, and the introduction of water meadows or connected wetlands adjacent to the river. The most effective strategy is to change land use or reduce fertiliser use, followed by water meadow creation, and atmospheric pollution controls. Finally, a combined approach involving all three strategies is investigated and shown to reduce in-stream nitrate concentrations to those pre-1950s even under climate change. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigated the relationship between agricultural land use and the forms of P (i.e., total phosphorus [TP], total dissolved phosphorus [TDP], and soluble reactive phosphorus [SRP]) in streams draining 8 headwater subcatchments in the Beaver River subwatershed, a major inflow to Lake Simcoe, which is a large hard-water lake in south-central Canada. The time period of analysis had a strong influence on the results. There was no relationship between percent total agriculture and average TP when concen-trations were averaged over the entire 12-month (Jun 2010–May 2011) monitoring period, whereas there were significant positive correlations between agricultural land use and average TP during the summer season (Jun–Aug). Significant cor-relations between average stream TDP and SRP and percent pastureland were observed, although relationships were again dependent on the time period of analysis. Concentrations of TP, TDP, and SRP were highly variable over time, with maximum concentrations occurring during the winter months. This was illustrated by a single rain-on-snow event (11 mm) on 5 March 2011, when samples taken 3–4 h apart varied by as much as 100{\%}. These results indicate that winter storm-targeted sampling is likely necessary to capture the full range of annual variability in P forms and concentrations.},

Concentration and deposition of ammonium, calcium, nitrate, and sulfate were tested for trends for the period 1993–2012. Precipitation trends were compared between the three monitoring networks for the winter seasons and downward trends were observed for both Snowpack and SNOTEL networks, but not for the NADP Wetfall network. The dry-deposition fraction of total atmospheric deposition, relative to wet deposition, was shown to be considerable in the region. Potential sources of regional airborne pollutant emissions were identified from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2011 National Emissions Inventory, and from long-term emissions data for the period 1996–2013. Changes in the emissions of ammonia, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide were reflected in significant trends in snowpack and wetfall chemistry. In general, ammonia emissions in the western USA showed a gradual increase over the past decade, while ammonium concentrations and deposition in snowpacks and wetfall showed upward trends.

abstract = {The hydrological response of rain-on-snow events has been studied on a plot scale at 2640 m altitude in the Austrian Alps. Three artificial rain events with different intensities and durations were simulated over two snow plots on a natural snowpack and the behaviour of emerging outflow was examined. Measurements of meteorological parameters, soil temperature and snowpack properties were also made. The investigations show that the impeding characteristics of the ice layers more than doubled the storage capacity of the snowpack. The speed of water movement was estimated to be about 6 m h-1 when the snow pack was fully saturated. Accelerated metamorphism under saturated conditions and preferential flow paths created owing to uneven snow surface caused by the impact of intense rain over the snow surface, are understood to be responsible for the high speed of water flow. This indicates that heavy rain water moves several times faster than the natural snowmelt under non-rainy conditions. Moreover, under rainy conditions, natural snowmelt also percolates faster along with rain water. Observations of the time of arrival of runoff, t(a) and time to equilibrium concentration of liquid water in snow, t(e), for different rain events indicate that after conditioning of the snowpack, a significant reduction of rain intensity (by half in the present study) is not able to change the distribution of runoff much; fast response of water was also observed under reduced rain-intensity. Another important aspect of the snowpack worth noting was that most of the input appeared as runoff. This stage of snowpack with high conductivity is found to be responsible for the production of high streamflows. Heavy rain either with snowmelt or alone can generate floods under such conditions. The importance of the role of rain water in conditioning the snowpack to yield maximum and fast runoff is due much more to input rather than to rain-induced snow melt.},

In high elevation catchments in the western United States, sources of N during this snowmelt flush include both atmospheric N deposition stored in the snowpack until melt and mobile soil N pools, and sinks are dominated by biogeochemical processes that occur in soil under snow cover. Because soil processes may serve either as a source or sink for N, controls on the amount of inorganic N leached from soil during the snowmelt period were evaluated in the major landscape types in four catchments in Colorado. Measurements of leached N were inversely related to measurements of over-winter CO2 flux at all sites, indicating that N was immobilized in soil heterotrophic biomass. Because over-winter soil heterotrophic activity is controlled primarily by the depth and timing of snow accumulation, the importance of these plot scale measurements to catchment scale N export were evaluated using a long-term record of winter precipitation, N deposition, and N export from Loch Vale in Rocky Mountain National Park. This data set identified a strong, linear relationship (r2=0{\textperiodcentered}68) between catchment scale N retention and winter snow cover, consistent with subnivean, soil based controls on the mobile N pool identified at the plot scale. These results indicate that the winter snow pack is the major control both on hydrologic N export and on soil source/sink relationships for N concurrent with this transport mechanism. The effect of winter snow cover on the fate of both atmospheric and soil N needs to be considered when evaluating potential the effects of increased N deposition on either terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems in seasonally snow-covered watersheds. In these systems, changes in surface water chemistry are likely to occur in high deposition, snow-covered sites during low snow years before terrestrial vegetation is affected.

abstract = {Acidification of lakes and streams is a serious water quality problem in high elevation granitic ecosystems in the northeastern US.  An important consequence of acidification is the mobilization of aluminium from the edaphic to the aquatic environment.  Elevated levels of aluminium may have serious ramifications for biological communities, particularly fish, inhabiting acidified aquatic systems.  In this study, water quality data were collected from several acidified lakes and streams in the Adirondack region of New York state.  The purpose of this investigation was to characterise aluminium chemistry in these acidified waters and to assess the relative toxicity of soluble aluminium species to fish.  Aqeous aluminium speciation was found to be highly variable in Adirondack waters, and its effect on fish was also variable.},

abstract = {Biological denitrification of wastewater using denitrifying forms of bacteria found in activated sludge is one of the currently proposed methods for nitrogen removal. The reduced biological activity associated with decreases in temperature is a particularly important parameter of biological denitrification where wastewater temperatures may decrease to approximately 5°C during the winter. Laboratory batch denitrification tests on a defined media utilizing a dominant culture of Pseudomonas denitrificans illustrate that the temperature dependency of the specific denitrification rate can be closely approximated by an Arrhenius temperature relationship. Linear nitrate and carbon removal rates were obtained following an initial lag period which increased with decreasing temperature. Rates ranging from 0.013 at 5°C to 0.16 mg NOa as N mg−1 of organisms h−1 at 27°C were observed. Data from tests using admixtures of activated sludge indicated that a significant number of denitrifying microorganisms were naturally present. Overall denitrification rates corresponding to those of Pseudomonas denitrificans would be observed when the suspended solids were 2.5–4.0 times those of the pure culture. From these studies it would appear that successful biological denitrification units can be designed in conjunction with existing activated sludge treatment facilities producing a nitrified effluent under winter conditions.},

abstract = {The benefits of no till (NT) management in the short to medium terms need to be examined over decades of continuous cropping. Our objectives were to (i) assess the long term effects of tillage practices (no-till (NT) and mouldboard plough [MP]) and biennial P×N fertilizer rates applied to the maize phase of a two-year maize–soybean rotation on grain yield, Mehlich-3 P (PM3), and Olsen P (POl), and (ii) determine whether NT practice affects the relationships between PM3, POl and P budgets. The study site was established in 1992 on a clay loam soil of the St-Blaise series (Dark Grey Gleysol). The experimental design is a split plot with NT and MP assigned to main plots and nine combinations of 3 P (0, 17.5, and 35kg Pha−1) and 3N (0, 80, and 160kg Nha−1) additions assigned to subplots. Maize and soybean grain yield response to P additions was obtained only twice between 1992 and 2010. On average, grain yields were reduced by 10–25{\%} in NT compared to MP treatments in 11 years. The dynamics over years of PM3 and POl (0–15cm) in unfertilized P treatment was similar in NT and MP. In contrast, P fertilized NT maintained greater PM3 and POl than MP. This difference in soil tests P was due to greater P accumulation in the 0–5cm and 5–10cm soil layers of NT. Under MP, soil tests P and P budgets over the P treatments were linearly related and for this specific MP treatment, we calculated that a P budget of ±100kg Pha−1 would change PM3 by 12kgha−1 and POl by 7kgha−1. Under NT, a cubic model fitted closely to the experimental data due principally to a more than proportional change in soil tests P relative to P budgets in fertilized P treatments. We conclude that additions of P fertilizer in NT systems changes the dynamics of P in the rooting zone, suggesting the importance of approaches to monitor P dynamics specifically tailored for NT systems that integrates the variability caused by the absence of mixing the fertilizer, residues, and soil.},

The process-based hydrological and nutrient flux model, HYPE, was set up for the entire Baltic Sea catchment area. The model was then used to examine how water and nutrient fluxes may change during four different climate scenarios. Changes to discharge varied regionally, with increases seen in the northeastern Baltic Sea catchment and decreases in the south and southwest. Changes to total nutrient loads did not necessarily follow the changes in discharge, indicating significant changes in nutrient concentrations. This indicates the importance of a process-based hydrological and nutrient model for analyses: it is the net result of several different nutrient sink and source processes that determine the predicted status of nutrients as a result of climate change.},

abstract = {Across Europe, elevated phosphorus (P) concentrations in lowland rivers have made them particularly susceptible to eutrophication. This is compounded in southern and central UK by increasing pressures on water resources, which may be further enhanced by the potential effects of climate change. The EU Water Framework Directive requires an integrated approach to water resources management at the catchment scale and highlights the need for modelling tools that can distinguish relative contributions from multiple nutrient sources and are consistent with the information content of the available data. Two such models are introduced and evaluated within a stochastic framework using daily flow and total phosphorus concentrations recorded in a clay catchment typical of many areas of the lowland UK. Both models disaggregate empirical annual load estimates, derived from land use data, as a function of surface/near surface runoff, generated using a simple conceptual rainfall–runoff model. Estimates of the daily load from agricultural land, together with those from baseflow and point sources, feed into an in-stream routing algorithm. The first model assumes constant concentrations in runoff via surface/near surface pathways and incorporates an additional P store in the river-bed sediments, depleted above a critical discharge, to explicitly simulate resuspension. The second model, which is simpler, simulates P concentrations as a function of surface/near surface runoff, thus emphasising the influence of non-point source loads during flow peaks and mixing of baseflow and point sources during low flows. The temporal consistency of parameter estimates and thus the suitability of each approach is assessed dynamically following a new approach based on Monte-Carlo analysis.},

abstract = {Shifts in oxic and anoxic conditions in soil are most frequently caused by water table fluctuations, heavy rain, snowmelt or flooding, with potentially significant impacts on microbial processes and the ability of soils to convert mineral nitrogen to nitrogen gases efficiently. The impact of oxic/anoxic cycles on nitrogen transformation rates was therefore explored in the upper layer (0–30 cm) of partially degraded peat soil. We hypothesized that high denitrification potential would be conserved due to the high organic matter content of this soil. Mineral nitrogen was applied to approximately 1-cm deep layers of homogenized soil in microcosms, with no external source of readily degradable carbon. Microcosms were subjected to three cycles, each consisting of an oxic phase of 8–11 days and an anoxic phase of 21–28 days. Approximately 2{\%} of the ammonium load was lost through ammonia volatilization during oxic phases and the remainder was nitrified. The accumulated nitrate decreased soil pH from 8.0 to 6.8 before its transformation through denitrification. Nitrification and denitrification rates during the three oxic/anoxic cycles (approximately three months) were 2.9–3.2 kg N ha−1 d−1 and 1.0–2.3 kg N ha−1 d−1, respectively. Extrapolation of these values to 30-cm deep soil layers gave rates that were sufficient for complete transformation of at least 1700 kg N ha−1 of ammonium to nitrogen gases, which is ten-fold greater than the annual nitrogen application of 170 kg N ha−1 permitted by the European directive. Denitrification rates decreased linearly during the three cycles (from 36 ± 2 to 16 ± 1 $\mu$g N g−1 d−1 dry soil), projecting cessation of denitrification activity and CO2 production during the fifth cycle. Storage of peat soil at 4 °C most probably allowed slow degradation of organic matter that was completely oxidized to CO2 after the soil was exposed to higher temperature (28 °C). Storage of soil for one year did not affect nitrification rate, but reduced denitrification rate, unless soil was amended with a readily degradable carbon source. The data suggest that, despite the high carbon content of this soil, it cannot sustain transformations of high N loads to nitrogen gases for prolonged periods without amendment with readily available carbon.},

abstract = {Nuisance blooms of heterocystous Cyanobacteria in Lake Winnipeg have nearly doubled in size since the mid 1990s. The increases are the result of a recent rapid increase in loading and concentration of phosphorus. The rapid increase in phosphorus is largely the result of two factors. The first factor is the result of rapidly increased livestock production and use of synthetic fertilizer in the Red River Valley, with smaller contributions of phosphorus from the city of Winnipeg and other human development in the Red and Winnipeg river basins. The second factor is the increased frequency and intensity of spring floods in the Red River watershed in recent years, which have greatly enhanced the transfer of phosphorus from the landscape to the lake, as well as slower increases in nitrogen. Because the low ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus in the increased inputs favors nitrogen fixing species of Cyanobacteria, these nuisance forms account for most of the increase in phytoplankton. Recovery of the lake will require reducing both agricultural and major urban sources of phosphorus and, if possible, the frequency and intensity of flooding in the Red River watershed. Flooding will be increasingly difficult to control if modeled predictions for increased precipitation under climate warming materialize. Even with targeted reductions in phosphorus inputs of 50{\%} and measures to control flooding, recovery of the lake is expected to be slow because of phosphorus recycled from sediments and the climatic sensitivity of this shallow lake and the flooding of the Red River. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A mathematical simulation model (ICECREAM), describing the phosphorus cycle in the soil and its losses from soil to water, was developed and applied to clayey soils in Finland. The model is based on the CREAMS and GLEAMS model, with some modifications to adapt it to local (climatic) conditions. The original erosion submodel (USLE) highly overestimated erosion for Finnish agricultural clayey soils with relatively steep slopes (i.e., 7{\%}-8{\%}). The calibration of poorly known and/or spatially varying input parameters, such as Manning s n, soil erodibility, and field capacity, did not sufficiently improve the agreement between simulated and measured data. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis of the erosion equations was carried out using Monte Carlo methods, varying both input and non-input parameters. This analysis showed that parameters in equations dependent on the slope, such as rill and interrill detachment rates, peak runoff rate, and equations related to sediment transport capacity were the most sensitive. Thus, those parameters were recalibrated, resulting in simulated annual sediment yields that approached the measured erosion rates, which ranged from 200 to 5000 kg ha-1 yr-1. Since the amount of phosphorus bound to sediments is closely correlated with the amount of eroded soil material, simulated sediment-bound phosphorus also corresponded better to the measurements.},

abstract = {It may be endemic to mechanistic modelling of complex environmental systems that there are many different model structures and many different parameter sets within a chosen model structure that may be behavioural or acceptable in reproducing the observed behaviour of that system. This has been called the equifinality concept. The generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identification allowing for equifinality is described. Prediction within this methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways of combining information from different types of model evaluation or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures.},

abstract = {The relationships of nitrogen biogeochemistry are reviewed, focusing on forested watersheds in North America, Europe and Japan. Changes in both local and global nitrogen cycles that affect the structure and function of ecosystems are described. Within northeastern United States and Europe, atmospheric deposition thresholds of ～8 and ～10 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, result in enhanced mobilization of nitrate. High nitrate concentrations and drainage water loss rates up to 22 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) have also been found near Tokyo. Although atmospheric deposition may explain a substantial portion of the spatial pattern of nitrate in surface waters, other factors also play major roles in affecting the spatial patterns of nitrogen biogeochemistry. Calcium availability influences the composition of the vegetation and the biogeochemistry of nitrogen. The abundance of sugar maple is directly linked to soil organic matter characteristics and high rates of nitrogen mineralization and nitrification. Seasonal patterns of nitrate concentration and drainage water losses are closely coupled with differences in seasonal temperature and hydrological regimes. Snow-dominated forested catchments have highest nitrate losses during snowmelt. Watersheds in the main island of Japan (Honshu) with high summer temperatures and precipitation inputs have greatest losses of nitrate occur during the late summer. Understanding future changes in nitrate concentrations in surface waters will require an integrated approach that will evaluate concomitantly the influence of both biotic and biotic factors on nitrogen biogeochemistry.},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) and sediment can move from agricultural land to surface waters, deteriorating its quality. This study was undertaken to improve understanding of partitioning of P and sediment to surface water via overland runoff and underground drainage pathways, and identify control measures. Over two full years, and including important winter events, P and sediment load overland and through tile were quantified from micro-catchments with relevant drainage and management practices imposed. Crop nutrients were supplied by liquid swine manure, either injected under minimum tillage management or surface-applied and incorporated under conventional till. Winters were temporally important for loadings from both runoff and drainage tile, particularly during rain on snow. A single event of 50mm rain on snow over 2 days contributed more than 80{\%} of the Pdop (dissolved organic+particulate P) and sediment that moved overland, and contributed 28{\%} of Pdop and 20{\%} of the sediment that moved through drainage tile during that season. Loads of P and sediment in both overland runoff and tile drainage were greater in non-growing seasons (NGSs) than growing seasons (GSs). For example, loading overland averaged 0.14kgha−1 dissolved reactive phosphate (DRP) and 1551kgha−1 sediment in NGSs, and 0.04kgha−1 DRP and 42kgha−1 sediment in GSs (four catchments, two seasons, runoff DRP first GS only). Through drainage tile, DRP load averaged 0.08kgha−1 in NGSs and 0.01kgha−1 in GSs from one field, A, and 0.02kgha−1 in NGSs and 0.003kgha−1 in GSs from another field, B; Pdop load was 0.07kgha−1 in NGSs and 0.02kgha−1 in GSs, similar from both Fields A and B; and sediment load was 23kgha−1 in NGSs from Field A, 8kgha−1 in NGSs from Field B, and 2kgha−1 in GSs from both fields. It is therefore important to manage movement during NGSs, particularly when runoff occurs over frozen soil. Movement through drainage tile comprised 31, 24 and 16{\%} of the overland+subsurface DRP, total P (Pt) and sediment loads, respectively. Presence or type (blind inlet or hickenbottom) of surface inlet had little impact on P and sediment loading. Artificial drainage reduced overland+subsurface load to surface water to one-third for Pt and one-tenth for sediment, and is therefore a suitable strategy for controlling both P and turbidity in surface water. Overland+subsurface DRP load was unchanged by artificial drainage. Preferential flow of liquid swine manure to drainage tile only occurred with injection, in the year the drains were installed, in one of two fields. Along with being infrequent, the incidental DRP load through tile drains comprised only 2{\%} of the annual Pt load from the catchment. The associated minimum tillage system reduced overland Pt and sediment runoff load 3- and 6-fold, respectively, relative to conventional till with broadcast incorporated manure.},

abstract = {The paper summarizes the results of 5 years of study of the interaction between snowmelt infiltration (INF), snow-cover water equivalent (SWE), and soil moisture content at the time of melt (0,) for soils in the Brown and Dark Brown zones of the Canadian Prairies. It is shown that in uncracked soils the depth infiltrating water percolates into the soil during the melt sequence is, on the average, approximately 30 cm and that 0, of the frozen layer at the soil surface (0-30 cm) is the dominant factor governing the amount of snowmelt infiltration, independent of soil texture and vegetative cover. Empirical expressions, in the form of power equations and graphs, are presented describing the relationship between the variables. Because of their simplicity they have direct practical application to a number of water management problems of the region. A conceptual model for describing the snowmelt infiltration phenomenon in operational water management schemes is presented. It divides the infiltration potential of Prairie soils into three broad categories: unlimited, limited, and restricted, based on the water entry, transmission, and storage properties of the frozen ground},

This characteristic is often advocated to justify the use of independent single-system models to maximise the outcome for the available computational resources. However, the rapid increase in computational power presently provides means to explore new and more complex modelling schemes, which better reflect the complex physical reality. We present a new modelling framework, FLUXOS, developed from the full coupling of modified versions of state-of-the-art standalone river and groundwater flow and transport models. The model is validated against analytical solutions and applied to real world scenarios in the complex urban corridor of the Ciliwung River in Jakarta to show its flexibility for practical applications and its capabilities as an exploratory tool for realistic investigation of contamination sources and pathways determining non-linear behaviours of river-aquifer interactions.},

abstract = {This study addresses the geologic and hydrogeochemical processes operating at a range of scales within the prairie pothole region (PPR). The PPR is a 750,000km2 portion of north central North America that hosts millions of small wetlands known to be critical habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife. At a local scale, we characterized the geochemical evolution of the 92-ha Cottonwood Lake study area (CWLSA), located in North Dakota, USA. Critical zone processes are the long-term determinant of wetland water and groundwater geochemistry via the interaction of oxygenated groundwater with pyrite in the underlying glacial till. Pyrite oxidation produced a brown, iron oxide-bearing surface layer locally over 13m thick and an estimated minimum of 1.3×1010g sulfate (SO42−) at CWLSA. We show that the majority of this SO42− now resides in solid-phase gypsum (CaSO4•2H2O) and gypsum-saturated groundwater. Results from the CWLSA were scaled up to a 9700km2 area surrounding CWLSA using {\~{}}1800 drill logs and literature data on wetland water chemistry for 178 wetlands within this larger area. The oxidized brown zone depth and wetland water compositional trends are very similar to the CWLSA. Additionally, surface water data from 176 southern Canadian pothole wetlands that conform to the same wetland water geochemical trends as those recorded in the CWLSA further corroborate that SO42− accumulation driven by pyrite oxidation is a nearly ubiquitous process in the prairie pothole region and distinguishes PPR wetlands from other wetlands worldwide that have a similar overall hydrology.},

abstract = {The Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) is a comprehensive model that was developed to simulate many processes related to water flow and quality in watersheds of almost any size and complexity. Paddy rice fields often dominate extensive portions of the landscape in the Asian monsoon region. The hydrological and environmental conditions of paddy fields differ somewhat from those of other land uses, and HSPF may not adequately simulate watersheds in paddy farming regions. HSPF was previously modified to HSPF-Paddy; here, we examined the applicability of the modified model. The model was applied to simulate the water flow and quality of the Saemangeum watershed (2523 km2) in Korea, where paddy rice fields comprise about one-third of the total watershed area. Long-term monitoring data (5 years for water flow, 10 years for water quality) were used in the calibration and verification processes. Model performance was in the range of "very good" and "good" based on model efficiency (R2) and percent difference. The accuracy of the daily simulation was lower than that of monthly simulation for water flow. The water-quality simulation results were encouraging for this sizable watershed with mixed land uses; HSPF-Paddy proved adequate, and its application is recommended to simulate watershed processes in paddy farming regions.},

abstract = {Highly resolved time series data are useful to accurately identify the timing, rate, and magnitude of solute transport in streams during hydrologically dynamic periods such as snowmelt. We used in situ optical sensors for nitrate (NO) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter fluorescence (FDOM) to measure surface water concentrations at 30 min intervals over the snowmelt period (March 21-May 13, 2009) at a 40.5 hectare forested watershed at Sleepers River, Vermont. We also collected discrete samples for laboratory absorbance and fluorescence as well as $\delta$O-NO isotopes to help interpret the drivers of variable NO and FDOM concentrations measured in situ. In situ data revealed seasonal, event and diurnal patterns associated with hydrological and biogeochemical processes regulating stream NO and FDOM concentrations. An observed decrease in NO concentrations after peak snowmelt runoff and muted response to spring rainfall was consistent with the flushing of a limited supply of NO (mainly from nitrification) from source areas in surficial soils. Stream FDOM concentrations were coupled with flow throughout the study period, suggesting a strong hydrologic control on DOM concentrations in the stream. However, higher FDOM concentrations per unit streamflow after snowmelt likely reflected a greater hydraulic connectivity of the stream to leachable DOM sources in upland soils. We also observed diurnal NO variability of 1-2 $\mu$mol l after snowpack ablation, presumably due to in-stream uptake prior to leafout. A comparison of NO and dissolved organic carbon yields (DOC, measured by FDOM proxy) calculated from weekly discrete samples and in situ data sub-sampled daily resulted in small to moderate differences over the entire study period (−4 to 1{\%} for NO and −3 to −14{\%} for DOC), but resulted in much larger differences for daily yields (−66 to +27{\%} for NO and −88 to +47{\%} for DOC, respectively). Despite challenges inherent in in situ sensor deployments in harsh seasonal conditions, these data provide important insights into processes controlling NO and FDOM in streams, and will be critical for evaluating the effects of climate change on snowmelt delivery to downstream ecosystems.},

abstract = {Determining the relative temperature sensitivities of the decomposition of the different soil organic matter (SOM) pools is critical for predicting the long-term impacts of climate change on soil carbon (C) storage. Although kinetic theory suggests that the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition should increase with substrate recalcitrance, there remains little empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. In the study presented here, sub-samples from a single bulk soil sample were frozen and sequentially defrosted to produce samples of the same soil that had been incubated for different lengths of time, up to a maximum of 124 days. These samples were then placed into an incubation system which allowed CO2 production to be monitored constantly and the response of soil respiration to short-term temperature manipulations to be investigated. The temperature sensitivity of soil CO2 production increased significantly with incubation time suggesting that, as the most labile SOM pool was depleted the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition increased. This study is therefore one of the first to provide empirical support for kinetic theory. Further, using a modelling approach, we demonstrate that it is the temperature sensitivity of the decomposition of the more recalcitrant SOM pools that will determine long-term soil-C losses. Therefore, the magnitude of the positive feedback to global warming may have been underestimated in previous modelling studies.},

It emphasizes the interrelations among plants, animals, and microbes, by first establishing the fundamental physical and chemical properties of the soil habitat and then functionally characterizing the major components of the soil biota and some of their most important interactions. The fundamental principles underpinning soil ecology are established and this then enables an integrated approach to explore and understand the processes of soil nutrient (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) cycling and the ecology of extreme soil conditions such as soil-water stress. Two of the most topical aspects of applied soil ecology are then selected. First, the ecology of soil pollution is examined, focusing on acid deposition and radionuclide pollution. Second, manipulation of soil ecology through biotechnology is discussed, illustrating the use of pesticides and microbial inocula in soils and pointing toward the future by considering the impact of genetically modified inocula on soil ecology.},

abstract = {Process-based hydrologic models are usually calibrated prior to application to ensure that they closely match reality. However, different hydrologic response to varied climatic conditions might affect model calibration and validation. A case study was conducted for a 901km2 watershed of northern Michigan to compare the effects of calibrating the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model with different climatic datasets representing drought (1948–1949) versus average (1969–1970) conditions. The effects of the different climatic conditions on parameter response and sensitivity were evaluated, and performance of the two calibration versions was compared using a common validation period, 1950–1965. For the drought- and average-calibration periods, models were well calibrated, as indicated by high Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients (E=0.8 and 0.9), and low deviation of discharge values (D=2.9{\%} and 3.4{\%}). Evapotranspiration parameters differed under the two sets of climatic conditions. The plant water uptake compensation factor (EPCO), appropriately reflected plant water uptake patterns in varied climatic conditions. Snow melting parameters differed between the two scenarios. A comparison of baseflow values simulated by SWAT versus those computed by a hydrograph separation method showed that the SWAT method treated most snowmelt as surface runoff, whereas the latter method treated much of it as baseflow. The drought-calibrated version of the model performed much better during the validation period (1950–1965) (E=0.8, D=2.6{\%}) than did the average-calibrated version (E=0.4, D=41.4{\%}).},

abstract = {In cold climates, snowmelt runoff often exceeds rainfall runoff during the year. Conservation tillage practices may be effective in reducing runoff during the cropping season but not during the snowmelt period. A plot study was conducted on a cropped hillslope to assess how tillage practices affect snowmelt runoff and the associated losses of sediment, phosphorus (P), and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Tillage systems were fall moldboard and chisel plowing with spring disking, and a ridge till system utilizing only the tillage associated with summer row cultivation. Tillage and planting were done up and down the slope. Ridge tilled plots had higher fall residue cover, retained more snow, had less surface roughness, and consequently produced more runoff than the moldboard plow treatment. The amount of runoff from chisel plowed plots was similar to runoff from ridge tilled plots despite a relatively rough surface and moderate amount of residue cover. Phosphorus losses in runoff were higher for the ridge till and chisel plow systems than for the moldboard plow system. For all tillage systems, soluble P represented a major portion (75{\%}) of the total P loss in snowmelt runoff. Although erosive losses in snowmelt were low, the P losses were substantial and merit consideration in studies evaluating management systems impact on surface water quality in regions where snowmelt runoff is important.},

@article{Lilbaek2008,
abstract = {Once meltwater reaches the base of a snowpack it can infiltrate the underlying stratum, runoff, or refreeze and form a basal ice layer. Basal ice formation is most common early in melt over saturated or very cold frozen soils. Initial meltwater becomes enriched in ion concentrations compared to the parent snow due to ion fractionation during thaw and percolation through the snowpack. If ion exclusion occurs during basal ice formation, further enrichment of initial runoff water ion concentrations might occur. The influence of basal ice formation on runoff water chemistry was examined by comparing ion concentrations in runoff water that had sustained basal ice contact, to meltwater before basal ice contact. A series of experiments, involving melting a snowpack in a large insulated box over a cold impermeable substrate in a temperature-controlled room, were carried out. A cooling system at the chemically inert base ensured formation of basal ice during snowmelt. Meltwater samples were collected throughout melt from within the snowpack using an extraction tube; runoff water was collected at the base. All samples were analysed for major anions and cations. Results showed that formation of basal ice layers can sometimes enrich the initial runoff water compared to meltwater before basal ice contact. Ion concentrations in basal ice contact runoff water were up to sixteen times greater than those in no-contact meltwater; however, on average, basal ice contact runoff water showed 1{\textperiodcentered}5 times the ion concentrations of the no-contact meltwater. Enrichment was greatest with the rapid formation of a thick basal ice layer. The implications are that basal ice formation alters both meltwater ion pathway and concentration. When no basal ice is present, enhanced infiltration of meltwater ion load can cause relatively dilute runoff water. When basal ice is present all meltwater runs off and further ion-concentration enrichment occurs.},

abstract = {Water flow through a melting snow pack modifies its structure and stability and affects the release of water and nutrients into soils and surface waters. Field and laboratory observations indicate a large spatial variability on various scales of the liquid water content and flow, a dominant system feature currently not included in numerical models. We investigated experimentally water and dye tracer movement through microstructurally different snow pack horizons and the persistence of preferential flow paths. Naturally rounded snow of varying grain size was artificially packed to obtain well known conditions by sieving it into rectangular bins. Surface melt was induced with infrared lamps. The flow paths were visualized with tracers and liquid water content was monitored with time domain reflectometry probes. Vertical cuts through the snow pack were imaged. The dye tracer patterns allowed the two flow regimes matrix flow and preferential flow to be distinguished. Matrix flow is apparently dominated by film and capillary flow in the unsaturated snow matrix. The capillary barrier effect at a boundary between a fine over a coarse textured layer on matrix flow in snow was confirmed. In contrast, preferential flow appears as well-defined flow fingers that advance from 0{\textperiodcentered}1 to 1 cm s-1. During a melt phase, the advancing flow fingers enlarge and are only partially time invariant. It remains to be shown whether the continuum concept, including the Darcy-Buckingham law is apt to describe the extremely non-linear nature of water flow and the travel time of solutes in snow under conditions of melt water percolation. Probably, snow packs that include faceted crystals and large variations in bulk density, feature more pronounced capillary barriers and preferential flow triggering, but also stronger impeding of fingers by lateral dispersion. Further, triggering and persistence of preferential flow is complicated by the usually transient infiltration rate.},

abstract = {A general parametric correlation for estimating snowmelt infiltration into frozen soils is developed using the results from a numerical model, HAWTS. This model includes a set of partial differential equations that describe water and heat transport with phase changes in frozen soils. The model was run for soils with average textures ranging from sandy loam to clay. The relationship proposed relates infiltration to the total soil moisture saturation (water + ice) and temperature at the start of snow ablation, the soil surface saturation during melting, and the infiltration opportunity time - the time that meltwater is available at the soil surface for infiltration. The expression is calibrated to predict snowmelt infiltration in boreal forest and prairie environments. Comparisons of estimates of infiltration by the empirical relationship with those determined by field measurement suggest that the correlation will provide acceptable estimates of snowmelt infiltration into frozen mineral soils for use in operational hydrology schemes.

abstract = {Alfalfa has been recognized for its superior yield and quality in seeded pastures. However, when grazing immature alfalfa there is a risk of animal losses due to frothy bloat in some ruminant livestock. Inclusion of at least 50{\%} grass in the pasture mixture is commonly recommended to reduce the risk of bloat. Two decades of plant breeding have resulted in the release of AC Grazeland, an alfalfa cultivar that reduces the incidence of bloat. Other bloat control agents such as pluronic detergents and ionophores can also be of value. Development of grazing-tolerant alfalfa varieties is solving some of the problems associated with lack of persistence of alfalfa in mixed stands; however, they are not bloat-safe. Animal productivity commonly increases when alfalfa is included in pasture mixtures. Improvements in cattle rate of gain are observed when alfalfa contributes as little as 35{\%} to the sward. Grazing management is the principal method for controlling pasture yield and quality as well as animal performance...},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) use in excess of crop needs may impact surface water quality and contribute to eutrophication. However, P loss from agricultural land to water has never been estimated at the Canadian national scale. In this paper, the risk of P desorption from Canadian agricultural land is assessed by the source component of the indicator of risk of water contamination by P (IROWC-P). The IROWC-P source component (P{\_}source) characterized the mobilization potential of soluble P and integrated four models of P desorption by water for dominant agricultural soil series of Canada on the soil landscape of Canada polygon scale (1:1,000,000). The objective of our study was to describe and evaluate a standardized method for deriving the P{\_}source component. The P{\_}source was assessed over 5-yr intervals from 1981 to 2006 for scientifically based knowledge by relating annual P balance values, soil test P (STP) analyses, soil P saturation index, and Self-Davis water extractable P extraction values. Results show trends of soil P enrichment for most Canadian provinces over the 25-yr period but also an increased percentage of farmland classified above the water extractable soil P environmental threshold of 4 mg P kg. The Canadian Prairies and Ontario showed small P{\_}source values and almost no farmland above the environmental threshold. Quebec and the Atlantic Provinces had P{\_}source values that exceeded the environmental threshold in 2006; more than 33{\%} of farmland is classified above the environmental threshold value.},

Trends in surface air temperature, precipitation, snow cover, and streamflow indices are examined along with the potential impact of low-frequency variability related to large-scale atmospheric and oceanic oscillations on these trends. The results show that temperature has increased significantly in most regions of Canada over the period 1948–2012, with the largest warming occurring in winter and spring. Precipitation has also increased, especially in the north. Changes in other climate and hydroclimatic variables, including a decrease in the amount of precipitation falling as snow in the south, fewer days with snow cover, an earlier start of the spring high-flow season, and an increase in April streamflow, are consistent with the observed warming and precipitation trends.

@article{Pote1999,
abstract = {Soils that contain high P levels can become a primary source of dissolved reactive P (DRP) in runoff, and thus contribute to accelerated eutrophication of surface waters. In a previous study on Captina soil, several soil test P (STP) methods gave results that were significantly correlated to DRP levels in runoff, but distilled H2O and NH4-oxalate methods gave the best correlations. Because results might differ on other soils, runoff studies were conducted on three additional Ultisols to identify the most consistent STP method for predicting runoff DRP levels, and determine effects of site hydrology on correlations between STP and runoff DRP concentrations. Surface soil (0-2 cm depth) of pasture plots was analyzed by Mehlich III, Olsen, Morgan, Bray-Kurtz P1, NH4-oxalate, and distilled H2O method. Also, P saturation of each soil was determined by three different methods. Simulated rain (75 mm h-1) produced 30 min of runoff from each plot. All correlations of STP to runoff DRP were significant (P {\textless} 0.01) regardless of soil series or STP method, with most STP methods giving high correlations (r {\textgreater} 0.90) on all three soils. For a given level of H2O-extractable STP, low runoff volumes coincided with low DRP concentrations. Therefore, when each DRP concentration was divided by volume of plot runoff, correlations to H2O-extractable STP had the same (P {\textless} 0.05) regression line for every soil. This suggests the importance of site hydrology in determining P loss in runoff, and may provide a means of developing a single relationship for a range of soil series.},

abstract = {Abstract The state of molecular orientation in a pure water surface is examined and it is concluded that the surface molecules are almost completely oriented with their negative vertices outward. Because of inter-molecular bonding this orientation decays approximately exponentially beneath the surface, the depth of orientation being about ten molecular layers. The driving energy for this orientation is supplied by the electrical asymmetry of the water molecule. When the surface of ice is examined it is found that the free energy of the system can be lowered if the ice surface is covered by a thin liquid layer. Molecules in the liquid surface are oriented, and the orientation decays in the depth of the layer. Thermodynamic calculations based on a molecular model suggest that the equilibrium film thickness is finite above a temperature of about −30°C and that the film thickness increases greatly as the melting point is approached. Typical film thicknesses are of the order of tens of Angstroms.},

Recent SWAT developments in landscape representation, stream routing, and soil P dynamics are presented in this collection. Numerous critical applications of the SWAT model were conducted across a variety of landscape scales, climatic and physiographic regions, and pollutant sources. In this article, model performance in terms of coefficient of determination, Nash‐Sutcliffe efficiency, and percent bias across all the studies is summarized and found to be satisfactory or better in all cases. These results are then compiled with a previous synthesis of results to generate a comprehensive assessment of SWAT. Model parameters used to calibrate the model for streamflow, sediment, N, and P in numerous studies are also summarized. This collection demonstrates that research in development and application of the SWAT model and associated tools continues to grow internationally in a wide range of settings and applications.},

abstract = {The natural cycle of nitrogen involves several biological and non-biological process including: mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, nitrogen fixation, microbial and plant uptake of nitrogen, ammonia volatilization, leaching of nitrite and nitrate and ammonia fixation. Nitrogen exists naturally in the environment and is constantly being converted from organic to an inorganic form and vice versa. Production of commercial fertilizer adds up to the natural source of nitrogen. The main source of nitrogen include: atmospheric precipitation, geological sources, agricultural land, livestock and poultry operations and urban waste. Agricultural emissions show a strong increase due to the application of fertilizer to agricultural soils, grazing of animals and spreading of animal manure. Emissions from agricultural practices and animal manure wastes are the major source of nitrogen pollution in surface and underground water. Soil erosion and runoff from fertilized land as well as domestic and industrial wastes contribute to the enrichment of lakes and streams with nutrients. Nitrates concentration exceeding certain limits in drinking water is toxic to animals and humans, especially infants. Nuisance of algal bloom and fish kills in lakes and rivers occurs due to eutrophication. Obnoxious colours and smells are developed as a result of organic matter decay and are destroying the natural beauty of the environment. The water born contaminants affect human health from both recreational use of contaminated surface water and from ingestion of contaminated drinking water derived from surface or ground water sources. The methods for abatement of nitrogen pollution must follow multi pathways. First, the source and amount of pollution must be detected and defined. Second, the possible ways to treat animal and domestic wastes should be carefully investigated. Third, better agricultural practices should be developed that include: proper storage and application of slurry and solid manure, rapid incorporation of slurry and solid manure into the soil, use of band spreading machineries such as trailing house and trailing shoe and sub-surface applicators, use of specifically made round covers fitted to above ground tanks and slurry lagoons, applying fertilizers during periods of greatest crop demand at or near the plant roots in smaller amounts with frequent applications, using multiple cropping systems such as using crop rotations or intercropping to increase the efficiency of nitrogen uses and changing current livestock production techniques.},

This review addresses the effects of freeze–thaw cycles on soil physical properties, microorganisms, carbon and nutrient dynamics, trace gas losses and higher organisms associated with soil. I discuss how the controlled manipulation of freeze–thaw cycles has varied widely among studies and propose that, despite their value in demonstrating the mechanisms of freeze–thaw action in soils, many studies of soil freeze–thaw cycles have used cycle amplitudes, freezing rates and minimum temperatures that are not relevant to temperature changes across much of the soil profile in situ. The lack of coordination between the timing of soil collection and the season for which freeze–thaw cycles are being simulated is also discussed. Suggested improvements to future studies of soil freeze–thaw cycles include the maintenance of realistic temperature fluctuations across the soil profile, soil collection in the appropriate season and the inclusion of relevant surface factors such as plant litter in the fall or excess water in the spring. The implications of climate change for soil freeze–thaw cycles are addressed, along with the need to directly assess how changes in soil freeze–thaw cycle dynamics alter primary production.},

abstract = {The hydrology and geochemistry of meltwaters and streams during rain-on-snow events in a small boreal watershed in eastern Canada indicated that rapid runoff might occur during pre-melt and early melt periods due to the presence of concrete frost in litter and upper organic soil horizons. The approximate extent of concrete frost cover in the catchment was estimated from prevailing meteorological conditions for the winter–spring periods in 1982–83 as “high” ({\textgreater}75{\%} cover); in 1983–84 as “medium” (≈50{\%} cover) and in 1984–85 as “low” ({\textless}5{\%} cover). When concrete frost coverage was medium to high then runoff was 20{\%} to 40{\%} of melt + rainfall to the concrete frost area of the basin. The efficiency with which runoff from concrete frost “contributing” areas reached the stream was 25–50{\%}, but increased to near 100{\%} for a high rain on snow event. However, the “efficiency” of chemical relocation in runoff from contributing areas varied from 60{\%} to 600{\%} depending on the species used as a tracer. This large range of values can be ascribed to the leaching of ground cover, litter and organic soil above or embedded in the frost cover, the patchiness of frost cover, erosion of the frost cover and flow through riparian zones. It is concluded that simple direct routing techniques will not always be able to successfully describe the complex phenomenon of runoff from variable frozen ground at small to medium scales.},

The model allows for plant uptake, surface and sub-surface pathways and can simulate up to six land uses simultaneously. The model can be applied to catchment as a semi-distributed simulation and has an inbuilt multi-reach structure for river systems. Sources of nitrogen can be from atmospheric deposition, from the terrestrial environment (e.g. agriculture, leakage from forest systems etc.), from urban areas or from direct discharges via sewage or intensive farm units. The model is a daily simulation model and can provide information in the form of time series at key sites, or as profiles down river systems or as statistical distributions. The process model is described and in a companion paper the model is applied to the River Tywi catchment in South Wales and the Great Ouse in Bedfordshire.},

abstract = {Mountain terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are responsive to external drivers of change, especially climate change and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N). We explored the consequences of a temperature-warming trend on stream nitrate in an alpine and subalpine watershed in the Colorado Front Range that has long been the recipient of elevated atmospheric N deposition. Mean annual stream nitrate concentrations since 2000 are higher by 50{\%} than an earlier monitoring period of 1991-1999. Mean annual N export increased by 28{\%} from 2.03 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) before 2000 to 2.84 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in Loch Vale watershed since 2000. The substantial increase in N export comes as a surprise, since mean wet atmospheric N deposition from 1991 to 2006 (3.06 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) did not increase. There has been a period of below average precipitation from 2000 to 2006 and a steady increase in summer and fall temperatures of 0.12 degrees C yr(-1) in both seasons since 1991. Nitrate concentrations, as well as the weathering products calcium and sulfate, were higher for the period 2000-2006 in rock glacier meltwater at the top of the watershed above the influence of alpine and subalpine vegetation and soils. We conclude the observed recent N increases in Loch Vale are the result of warmer summer and fall mean temperatures that are melting ice in glaciers and rock glaciers. This, in turn, has exposed sediments from which N produced by nitrification can be flushed. We suggest a water quality threshold may have been crossed around 2000. The phenomenon observed in Loch Vale may be indicative of N release from ice features such as rock glaciers worldwide as mountain glaciers retreat.},

abstract = {Solute releases from a seasonal snowpack are important features of spring runoff in temperate climate zones because meltwater accounts for a significant proportion of contaminant loading to catchments. Here we report a study that traces the movement of natural and artificial solutes in snow through the processes of snow deposition, snowpack metamorphism, and snowmelt at the Central Sierra Snow Laboratory (CSSL), Soda Springs, California, USA. Rare earth elements (REEs) were added to the snowpack to mark individual snow layers. New snow, snowpack profiles and snowmelt were sampled and analyzed for REE and anion (SO42-, Cl− and NO3-) concentrations. Correlations between NO3- and SO42- concentrations increased from new snow to snowpack profiles and to snow melt, suggesting significant redistributions of natural solutes in the snowpack. The maximum concentrations of NO3- and SO42- were both five times greater in the snow melt than in the new snow. Solute release by the snowpack was strongly controlled by weather conditions; high concentrations of natural tracers were observed at the onset of intensive melting episodes separated by relatively cold days of little melting. This weather pattern resulted in three ionic pulses rather than one. Natural solutes also showed a diurnal variation that was negatively correlated with the diurnal melting cycle. This pattern can be simulated by the standard water percolation equation linked with a mobile–immobile solute transport model (MIM). The diurnal variations of REE tracers showed positive association with the discharge, and cannot be satisfactorily simulated by the same model, suggesting that additional physical processes, such as dual or multiple flow regimes, may be needed to accurately describe solute transport in snow.},

In northern areas, it is assumed that soil residual mineral N measured at harvest represents the pool at risk of environmental loss during the non-growing season. Using 15N-tracing techniques we determined (i) the distribution of side-dressed pig slurry N in the mineral, organic and clay-fixed N pools of sandy loam and clay soils, and (ii) whether 15N found in each individual pool at harvest is retained or lost during the non-growing season. Pig slurry labelled with 15N was side-dressed to corn (four-leaf stage; 100 kg ha-1 total N) and traced in soil (0-60 cm) and plants for 2 yr. Pig slurry contained 60{\%} of its N as NH4. During the growing season, applied N accumulated in the clay-fixed N pool in the clay soil, and in the organic N pool in both soils. At harvest, less than 5{\%} of side-dressed N was present as soil mineral N, whereas 60 to 65{\%} was in the organic and clay-fixed pools. Although these forms are considered immobilized, one-third to one-half was lost during the non-growing season. This work provides evidence that the soil organic and clay-fixed N pools contribute to the loss of soil N during the non-growing season in cold areas, which should be included in future indicators for the risk of soil N loss.},

abstract = {The contribution of rain-on-snow (ROS) events to NO3-N levels in stream water has received relatively little research attention. However, individual ROS events during January and February contributed up to 40{\%} of annual NO3-N export from a forested catchment in south-central Ontario between 1980 and 2000, but comprised less than 10{\%} of annual precipitation. Nitrate-N concentrations in stream water increased rapidly following ROS events, and were similar to the concentrations in incident rainfall and the accumulated snow pack, likely due to limited contact of runoff with mineral soil under snow cover and low winter biological activity. Increased NO3-N associated with ROS events resulted in substantial depressions in stream pH and alkalinity, which may delay the biological recovery from acidification. The contribution of ROS events to annual or winter NO3-N export has been generally greater in recent years, although there is a considerable year-to-year variation. As a result, ROS events contribute to inter-annual variability in stream NO3-N concentrations and will have a strong effect on apparent temporal trends. The contribution of ROS events to annual NO3-N export should be considered when assessing surface water recovery from acidification and the N-status of forests, particularly if climate change projections for winter warming result in a greater proportion of winter precipitation occurring as rain.},

abstract = {Data from 57 wetlands from around the world have been collated to investigate whether wetlands affect the nutrient loading of waters draining through them; the majority of wetlands reduced nutrient loading and there was little difference in the proportion of wetlands that reduced N to those that reduced P loading. However, some wetlands increased nutrient loadings by increasing the loading of soluble N and P species thus potentially driving aquatic eutrophication. Studies conducted over a period of a year or more, or that involved frequent sampling during high flow events, were more likely to inidcate that the wetland increased nutrient loadings. Swamps and marshes differed from riparian zones in their nutrient function characteristics by being slightly more effective at nutrient reduction than riparian zones. The attributes that enable wetlands to be effective in reducing N and P loadings need consideration when constructing or manageing wetlands to reduce nutrient loadings.

abstract = {Groundwater recharge and discharge (base flow) estimates from two methods were compared in the Upper Mississippi River basin (USGS hydrologic cataloging unit 07). The Upper Mississippi basin drains 491,700km2 in Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, and Wisconsin and outlets in the Mississippi River north of Cairo, Illinois. The first method uses the water balance components from the soil and water assessment tool model (SWAT). The model was used to simulate the daily water balance of approximately 16 soil/land use hydrologic response units (HRU) within each of the 131 USGS 8-digit watersheds. The water balance of each HRU is simulated with four storages: snow, soil (up to ten layers), shallow aquifer, and deep aquifer. Groundwater recharge is defined as water that percolates past the bottom soil layer into the shallow aquifer. Recharge is lagged to become base flow and can also be lost to ET. The second method consists of two procedures to estimate base flow and recharge from daily stream flow: (1) a digital recursive filter to separate base flow from daily flow and (2) a modified hydrograph recession curve displacement technique to estimate groundwater recharge. These procedures were applied to 283 USGS stations ranging in area from 50 to 1200km2. A smoothed surface was obtained using a thin plate spline technique and estimates were averaged for each 8-digit basin. Simulated flow was calibrated against average annual flow for each 8-digit. Without further calibration, simulated monthly stream flow was compared against measured flow at Alton, Illinois (445,000km2) from 1961–1980. To validate the model, measured and simulated monthly stream flow at Alton from 1981–1985 were compared with an R2 of 0.65. No attempt was made to calibrate base flow and recharge independent of total stream flow. Base flow and recharge from both methods were shown to be in general agreement. The filter and recession methods have the potential to provide realistic estimates of base flow and recharge for input into regional groundwater models and as a check for surface hydrologic models.},

We investigated soil N supply capacity and fertilizer N recovery for three cropping systems established in 1977: silage corn (Zea mays L.)–cereal without (CC) and with 20 Mg ha−1 yr−1 manure (CCM), and silage corn–forage (3-yr) with manure (CFM). During the present study (2005–2008), manure applications were suspended and a silage corn–silage corn–barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.)–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) sequence was imposed to all systems. Fertilizer (15NH4 15NO3, 3.1 atom {\%} 15N) was applied in 2005 to silage corn (160 kg N ha−1) and in 2007 to barley (80 kg N ha−1). The 15N recovery in silage corn and barley ranged from 40 to 59{\%}, with the lowest values measured in CFM. Compared to the CC systems (47 kg N ha−1) in 2005, soil-derived N in silage corn was two times higher under CCM (98 kg N ha−1), and four times higher under CFM (208 kg N ha−1). These differences decreased over years, but were still noticeable at the end of the experiment. Twenty-two to 58{\%} of applied 15N was recovered in the soil at harvest. More than 50{\%} of this residual N was present in macroaggregates ({\textgreater}0.25 mm), whereas {\textless}20{\%} was present in particulate organic matter (POM). Up to 75{\%} of residual 15N was lost during the winter period, and little residual N was transferred to the following crop. These findings indicate that soil macroaggregates may be a preferential sink for residual fertilizer N, but this N is not present in stable forms and is vulnerable to environmental loss.},

abstract = {Ground water occurrence, movement, and its contribution to streamflow were investigated in Loch Vale, an alpine catchment in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Hydrogeomorphologic mapping, seismic refraction measurements, and porosity and permeability estimates indicate that talus slopes are the primary ground water reservoir, with a maximum storage capacity that is equal to, or greater than, total annual discharge from the basin (5.4 ± 0.8 × 106 m3). Although snowmelt and glacial melt provide the majority of annual water flux to the basin, tracer tests and gauging along a stream transect indicate that ground water flowing from talus can account for ≥75{\%} of streamflow during storms and the winter base flow period. The discharge response of talus springs to storms and snowmelt reflects rapid transmittal of water through coarse debris at the talus surface and slower release of water from finer-grained sediments at depth. Ice stored in permafrost (including rock glaciers) is the second largest ground water reservoir in Loch Vale; it represents a significant, but seldom recognized, ground water reservoir in alpine terrain. Mean annual air temperatures are sufficiently cold to support permafrost above 3460 m; however, air temperatures have increased 1.1° to 1.4°C since the early 1990s, consistent with long-term (1976–2000) increases in air temperature measured at other high-elevation sites in the Front Range, European Alps, and Peruvian Andes. If other climatic factors remain constant, the increase in air temperatures at Loch Vale is sufficient to increase the lower elevational limit of permafrost by 150 to 190 m. Although this could cause a short-term increase in streamflow, it may ultimately result in decreased flow in the future.},

Monitoring was carried out at the inflows and outflows of the four sub-basins from mid-March until the end of October in 1997 to 1999. Data were col-lected on flow, total phosphorus (TP) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). The TP and TDP concentrations increased and were greatest during spring snowmelt and rainfall runoff events. Median TP concentrations varied from 0.022 to 1.141 mg L -1 and median TDP concentrations varied from 0.005 to 1.031 mg L -1 . Within the sub-basins, phosphorus concentrations generally increased between inflow and outflows. The presence of grassland and well-developed crop cover adjacent to the watercourses generally resulted in a greater proportion of TDP in runoff. The proportion of TP as TDP varied from 31 to 97{\%} and appeared to be affected by the timing of the storm and antecedent moisture conditions of the soil. The proportion of phosphorus exported during events made up from 1 to 83{\%} of the total phosphorus load during the post-spring runoff period. Phosphorus concentrations exceeded Alberta surface water quality guidelines most of the time; however, the addition of irrigation return flow water generally improved water quality in Crowfoot Creek.},

abstract = {Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) stored in the snowpack are important sources of N in snow-covered ecosystems, yet we have limited knowledge of their fate during the melt period. Our objective was to quantify the role of hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in regulating stream fluxes of DIN (NO3− + NH4+) and DON in a forest-dominated and a wetland-dominated catchment during the snowmelt period. We combined isotopic hydrograph separation with concurrent measurements of meltwater DIN and DON to calculate “conservative” N export (hydrologic mixing only) and compared it with “reactive” N export (i.e., observed fluxes that include biogeochemical processes). On balance, N was retained in the catchments during snowmelt because of storage of meltwater N in soils, but our N export comparison revealed N generation (mostly as DON) from the mobilization of dissolved organic matter. In contrast, NO3−, which was highly enriched in snowpack meltwater, remained below detection in streams, and both catchments were sinks for NO3−, suggesting that denitrification and/or uptake may be important at the catchment scale. Over the melt period, the forest catchment was a greater total N source because of the convergence of lateral flow and near-stream riparian N sources in surface soils, which elevated stream DON and to a lesser extent NH4+. In contrast, preferential flow in the wetland catchment tended to dilute DIN in saturated peatland soils and in the stream, whereas DON varied little over time. These findings highlight the importance of hydrologic processes that store meltwater N in catchment soils but at the same time deliver DON from riparian sources to the stream. Further, model results suggest that biotic uptake and/or sorption effectively retain much of the meltwater DIN from the snowpack. Collectively, hydrologic storage and biogeochemical processes act to retain N that is likely important for boreal ecosystem production later in the spring and summer seasons.},

abstract = {ConspectusChemical interactions at the air–ice interface are of great importance to local atmospheric chemistry but also to the concentrations of pollutants deposited onto natural snow and ice. However, the study of such processes has been hampered by the lack of general, surface-specific probes. Even seemingly basic chemical properties, such as the local concentration of chemical compounds, or the pH at the interface, have required the application of assumptions about solute distributions in frozen media. The measurements that have been reported have tended for the most part to focus on entire ice or snow samples, rather than strictly the frozen interface with the atmosphere.We have used glancing-angle laser spectroscopy to interrogate the air–ice interface; this has yielded several insights into the chemical interactions there. The linear fluorescence and Raman spectra thus measured have the advantage of easy interpretability; careful experimentation can limit their probe depth to that which is relevant...},

abstract = {The relations between soil pore structure induced by tillage and infiltration play an important role in flow characteristics of water and solutes in soil. In this study, we assessed the effect of long-term use of various tillage systems on pore size distribution, areal porosity, stained (flow-active) porosity and infiltration of silt loam Eutric Fluvisol. Tillage treatments were: (1) ploughing to the depth of 20cm (conventional tillage (CT)); (2) ploughing to 20cm every 6 years and to 5cm in the remaining years (S/CT); (3) harrowing to 5cm each year (S); (4) sowing to the uncultivated soil (no tillage (NT)), all in a micro-plot experiment. Equivalent pore size distribution was derived from the water retention curve, areal porosity – from resin-impregnated blocks (8cm×9cm×4cm) and stained porosity – from horizontal sections (every 2cm) of column samples (diameter: 21.5cm, height: 20cm) taken after infiltration of methylene blue solution. The pore size distribution curves indicated that the textural peaks of the pore throat radius of approximately 1$\mu$m were mostly defined under NT, whereas those in the structural domain of radii of 110$\mu$m radius—under CT. The differences among the tillage treatments were more pronounced at depth 0–10cm than 10–20cm. At both depths, the differences in pore size distribution between the tillage treatments were relatively greater in structural than those in the matrix domain. CT soil had the greatest areal porosity and stained porosity. The stained porosity as a function of depth could be well described by logarithmic equations in all treatments. Cumulative infiltration (steady state) as measured by the double ring infiltrometer method was the highest under CT (94.5cm) and it was reduced by 62, 36 and 61{\%} in S/CT, S and NT soil, respectively. Irrespective of tillage method, cumulative infiltration rates throughout 3h most closely correlated with stained porosity in top layers (0–6cm). Overall, the results indicate that soil pore system under CT with higher contribution of large flow-active pores compared to reduced and no tillage treatments enhanced infiltration and water storage capacity.},

abstract = {A three-year study (2010, 2013 and 2014) was conducted to identify temporal and spatial patterns in phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and loads in 11 sub-watersheds of the Red River Valley, Manitoba, Canada in relation to human activity on the landscape. Discharge exhibited a strong seasonal pattern in all sub-watersheds with high discharge during snowmelt, generally lower discharge with rainfall-induced peaks during spring, summer and fall, and low or no discharge during winter. Consistent with the hydrologic pattern, nutrient concentrations were highest during snowmelt such that 62{\%} of the annual TP load and 67{\%} of the annual TN load were delivered during the 12–18day snowmelt period. Partial least squares regression analysis indicated that land use activities such as fertilizer application, livestock density and sewage were critical factors influencing TP and TN concentrations. In contrast, physical aspects such as water temperature and discharge were the primary determinants of TP and TN loads. The finding that stream water nutrients concentrations are associated with human activity on the landscape whereas nutrient loads are largely influenced by hydrologic events suggests that different types of beneficial management practices are needed for protection of instream ecological processes negatively affected by high nutrient levels versus reduction of nutrient export to downstream receiving bodies such as Lake Winnipeg.},

abstract = {Organic matter transformations take place in snow-covered soils during winter but in ways still poorly understood. Given the generally high soil water content and possible formation of ice layers during this period, anaerobic zones could develop and have determinant effects on soil C and N dynamics. The fate of C and N under wet and cold conditions was monitored in a sandy loam and a clay soil which were either unamended (control) or amended with cattle manure, pig slurry, maize or alfalfa residues. Soil samples were incubated for 84d during winter at constant water potential (−6kPa) in sealed containers laid on the floor of an unheated greenhouse. The containers were covered with fibre glass wool to simulate a snow cover. The O2, CO2 and N2O concentrations were periodically monitored in the headspace of the containers, whereas K2SO4-extractable C, KCl-extractable NO3− and NH4+, and volatile fatty acids were quantified in soil sub-samples. Despite the low soil temperature (average of 1°C), O2 consumption and CO2 production rates were significantly (P{\textless}0.05) increased by the amendments for the first 29d of incubation. After 29d, the O2 concentration fell below 6{\%} and CO2 production rate decreased in all amended soils. We assumed that after 29d aerobic respiration was replaced with fermentation processes in amended soils as indicated by respiratory quotients generally larger than 2, and by the progressive accumulation of volatile fatty acids. As O2 was consumed in sealed containers, nitrification decreased whereas ammonification continued and N2O production increased. As a result, soil NH4+ content increased whereas NO3− content was progressively depleted. After complete exhaustion of NO3−, the accumulated N2O disappeared and was probably reduced to N2. All measured parameters indicated that pig slurry and alfalfa stimulated soil microbial activities more than cattle manure and maize residues and these differences were partly related to the lignin-to-N ratio of the various amendments. Our data indicated that (i) significant C and N transformations occurred during winter in wet and cold soils amended with organic residues, (ii) under these conditions C and N dynamics were strongly influenced by O2 availability, and (iii) the rates at which C and N transformations occurred were partly determined by both C degradability and N availability of the organic amendments.},

abstract = {There are now considerable expectations that semi-distributed models are useful tools for supporting catchment water quality management. However, insufficient attention has been given to evaluating the uncertainties inherent to this type of model, especially those associated with the spatial disaggregation of the catchment. The Integrated Nitrogen in Catchments model (INCA) is subjected to an extensive regionalised sensitivity analysis in application to the River Kennet, part of the groundwater-dominated upper Thames catchment, UK The main results are: (1) model output was generally insensitive to land-phase parameters, very sensitive to groundwater parameters, including initial conditions, and significantly sensitive to in-river parameters; (2) INCA was able to produce good fits simultaneously to the available flow, nitrate and ammonium in-river data sets; (3) representing parameters as heterogeneous over the catchment (206 calibrated parameters) rather than homogeneous (24 calibrated parameters) produced a significant improvement in fit to nitrate but no significant improvement to flow and caused a deterioration in ammonium performance; (4) the analysis indicated that calibrating the flow-related parameters first, then calibrating the remaining parameters (as opposed to calibrating all parameters together) was not a sensible strategy in this case; (5) even the parameters to which the model output was most sensitive suffered from high uncertainty due to spatial inconsistencies in the estimated optimum values, parameter equifinality and the sampling error associated with the calibration method; (6) soil and groundwater nutrient and flow data are needed to reduce uncertainty in initial conditions, residence times and nitrogen transformation parameters, and long-term historic data are needed so that key responses to changes in land-use management can be assimilated. The results indicate the general difficulty of reconciling the questions which catchment nutrient models are expected to answer with typically limited data sets and limited knowledge about suitable model structures. The results demonstrate the importance of analysing semi-distributed model uncertainties prior to model application, and illustrate the value and limitations of using Monte Carlo-based methods for doing so.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.The nitrate (NO3-) dual isotope approach was applied to snowmelt, tundra active layer pore waters, and underlying permafrost in Barrow, Alaska, USA, to distinguish between NO3- derived from atmospheric deposition versus that derived from microbial nitrification. Snowmelt had an atmospheric NO3- signal with $\delta$15N averaging -4.8 ± 1.0‰ (standard error of the mean) and $\delta$18O averaging 70.2 ± 1.7‰. In active layer pore waters, NO3- primarily occurred at concentrations suitable for isotopic analysis in the relatively dry and oxic centers of high-centered polygons. The average $\delta$15N and $\delta$18O of NO3- from high-centered polygons were 0.5 ± 1.1‰ and -4.1 ± 0.6‰, respectively. When compared to the $\delta$15N of reduced nitrogen (N) sources, and the $\delta$18O of soil pore waters, it was evident that NO3- in high-centered polygons was primarily from microbial nitrification. Permafrost NO3- had $\delta$15N ranging from approximately -6‰ to 10‰, similar to atmospheric and microbial NO3-, and highly variable $\delta$18O ranging from approximately -2‰ to 38‰. Permafrost ice wedges contained a significant atmospheric component of NO3-, while permafrost textural ice contained a greater proportion of microbially derived NO3-. Large-scale permafrost thaw in this environment would release NO3- with a $\delta$18O signature intermediate to that of atmospheric and microbial NO3. Consequently, while atmospheric and microbial sources can be readily distinguished by the NO3- dual isotope technique in tundra environments, attribution of NO3- from thawing permafrost will not be straightforward. The NO3- isotopic signature, however, appears useful in identifying NO3- sources in extant permafrost ice.},

These lakes exhibit tremendous diversity in terms of hydrology, morphology, chemical composition, and sedimentary processes. Although many basins exhibit playa characteristics, the region also contains several of North America's largest lakes. Salinity and ionic composition show great diversity, with virtually every type of water chemistry represented. Associated with this large range in brine chemistry is an equally diverse assemblage of endogenic and authigenic minerals. Although investigation of the Holocene stratigraphic records in these basins is in its infancy, some approaches, such as deciphering paleochemistry and paleohydrology from the endogenic mineral record and isotopic composition, have proven to be successful. Challenges for both fundamental and applied researchers are to integrate, on a regional basis, the sedimentological and geochemical complexities exhibited by modern lakes with the preserved stratigraphic records.},

abstract = {Knowledge of hydrological pathways is essential for an understanding of ability of riparian buffers to mitigate the impact of diffuse pollutants on freshwater ecosystems. We examined flow paths and source areas of contaminants in an agricultural catchment in NE Poland during snowmelts in 2009 and 2010. End-member mixing analysis showed that stream chemistry was controlled by the shallow runoff components. Their contribution to stream runoff varied significantly depending on soil frost, catchment wetness and the water input from snowmelt. In 2009 overland/rill flow was the main mechanism of runoff generation because of the low permeability of the frozen ground. Overland flow had the pronounced impact on stream chemistry during peak discharges, when it amounted up to 70{\%} of discharge (Q). Riparian ground/soilwater runoff was important component of runoff throughout stream recession, when it contributed up to 50{\%} of Q. High catchment wetness, lack of soil frost and large snowmelt input in 2010 resulted in enhanced infiltration and rapid and large groundwater response. Melt water and tile drain outflow were found to be the major peak runoff components. In 2009 overland flow together with discharge of shallow groundwater were responsible for the export of 88{\%} of nitrate and 98{\%} of orthophosphate. During snowmelt of 2010 70{\%} of NO3− and 80{\%} of PO43− moved via tile drain network. As migration of chemicals was controlled by preferential flow structures, it is very likely that vast majority of contaminants fluxes bypassed buffers and structures, which could constrain their impact on stream quality.},

abstract = {A conceptual model is presented that represents the development of unstable flow in uniform soils during redistribution. The flow instability results in the propagation of fingers that drain water from the wetted soil matrix until equilibrium is reached. The model uses soil retention and hydraulic functions, plus relationships describing finger size and spatial frequency. The model assumes that all soils are unstable during redistribution, but shows that only coarse-textured soils will form fingers capable of moving appreciable distances. Once it forms, a finger moves downward at a rate governed by the rate of loss of water from the soil matrix, which can be predicted from the hydraulic conductivity function. Fingers are assumed to stay narrow as a result of hysteresis, which prevents lateral diffusion. The draining front in the soil matrix between the fingers is assumed to cease downward movement because water pressure drops below the threshold water-entry matric potential. The threshold potential is not present in the conventional Richards equation of soil water flow, which explains why unstable flow is not predicted by widely used simulation model codes.},

abstract = {The fate of pig (Sus scrofa) slurry labeled with 15N was investigated when applied on a clay soil (fine, mixed, frigid, Typic Humaquept) and a sandy loam (loamy, mixed, frigid, Typic Dystrochrept) cropped to maize (Zea mays L.) in 2000 and to barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in 2001. The slurry was applied in spring 2000, and plant and soil samples were collected at 6 h (Day 1) and at Days 14, 42, 96, and 413 after application. The samples were analyzed for 15N content in plant, in whole soil, and in soil NH4 +–N, NO3 −–N, organic N, and clay-fixed N pools. Percentage 15N recovery was {\textgreater}93{\%} in both soils at Day 1 and decreased slowly thereafter. Rapid clay fixation of slurry 15N occurred at Day 1, and was greater in the clay soil (34{\%} of applied 15N) than in the sandy loam (11{\%}). At Day 96, less of the applied slurry 15N was recovered in maize grown on the clay soil (29{\%}), as compared with the sandy loam (50{\%}). At the same period, the residual soil 15N was mostly present as organic N and NO3 −–N in the sandy loam, and as organic and clay-fixed N in the clay soil. At Day 413, 15N recovery in barley was about 3{\%} of the initially applied N in both soils. The 15N recovery was generally higher in the clay soil than in the sandy loam, but total 15N recovery from the soil–plant system was similar for both soils. We conclude that soil type had little influence on the total 15N recovery from the soil–plant system, but significantly influenced the fate of slurry N in the various soil pools and plant N uptake on the year of application.},

abstract = {This paper presents ArcGIS-SWAT, a geodata model and geographic information system (GIS) interface for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The ArcGIS-SWAT data model is a system of geodatabases that store SWAT geographic, numeric, and text input data and results in an organized fashion. Thus, it is proposed that a single and comprehensive geodatabase be used as the repository of a SWAT simulation. The ArcGIS-SWAT interface uses programming objects that conform to the Component Object Model (COM) design standard, which facilitate the use of functionality of other Windows-based applications within ArcGIS-SWAT. In particular, the use of MS Excel and MATLAB functionality for data analysis and visualization of results is demonstrated. Likewise, it is proposed to conduct hydrologic model integration through the sharing of information with a not-model-specific hub data model where information common to different models can be stored and from which it can be retrieved. As an example, it is demonstrated how the Hydrologic Modeling System (HMS) - a computer application for flood analysis - can use information originally developed by ArcGIS-SWAT for SWAT. The application of ArcGIS-SWAT to the Seco Creek watershed in Texas is presented.},

In order to assess the evolution of these events in a recent past, and the potential changes that could be experienced in a changing climate over coming decades, we have focused on a small catchment in north-eastern Switzerland, the Sitter, well-endowed with both climate and hydrological data. Observations show that there has been an increase in the number of rain-on-snow events since the early 1960s related to the rise in atmospheric temperatures. Results from a simple temperature-based snow model show that the number of ROS events could increase by close to 50{\%} with temperatures 2–4°C warmer than today, before declining when temperatures go beyond 4°C. The likelihood of more ROS events suggests that the risks of flooding in a future climate may indeed get worse before they improve.},

abstract = {The release of organic contaminants from melting snow poses risks to aquatic and terrestrial organisms and to humans who rely on drinking water and food production from regions that are seasonally snow-covered. Measured and model-predicted spring peak concentrations in waters receiving snowmelt motivate a thorough investigation of organic contaminant behaviour during melting. On the basis of the current understanding of snow metamorphosis, snowmelt hydrology and chemical partitioning in snow, this critical review aims to provide a qualitative picture of the processes involved in the release of organic contaminants from a melting snowpack. The elution sequence of organic substances during snowmelt is strongly dependent on their environmental partitioning properties and the physical properties of the snowpack. Water-soluble organic contaminants can be discharged in greatly elevated concentrations at an early stage of melting, while the bulk of the hydrophobic chemicals attached to particles is often released at the end of the melt period. Melting of a highly metamorphosed and deep snowpack promotes such shock load releases, whereas a shallow snow cover over a relatively warm ground experiencing irregular melting over the winter season is unlikely to generate notable peak releases of organic substances. Meltwater runoff over frozen ground directly transfers contaminant shock loads into receiving water bodies, while permeable soils buffer and dilute the contaminants. A more quantitative understanding of the behaviour of organic contaminants in varying snowmelt scenarios will depend on controlled laboratory studies combined with field investigations. Reliable numerical process descriptions will need to be developed to integrate water quality and contaminant fate models. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Without proper subsurface drainage of heavy clay soil, water logging due to low hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil and especially the subsoil will lead to abundant surface runoff. The abundant runoff will induce soil erosion and phosphorus losses. To determine the influence of improved subsurface drainage (IMP) on soil erosion, phosphorus losses and nitrogen leaching, a heavy clay soil with a 29 year old subdrainage system was fitted with new drains, with topsoil or wood chips used as backfill in the drain trenches. Before IMP, drainage water constituted only 10–40{\%} of the total runoff (drainage+surface runoff) but after IMP 50–90{\%}. Where topsoil was used as backfill, the estimated soil erosion and particulate P and dissolved orthophosphate P losses from ploughed soil during winter were lower after IMP than before (1168 vs. 1408 kg ha−1, 0.58 vs. 0.69 kg ha−1, 0.09 vs. 0.12 kg ha−1, respectively). Where wood chips were used as backfill, soil erosion and particulate P losses were not reduced. Owing to the increased drainage discharge, nitrogen leaching during barley cultivation was much higher after IMP (14 vs. 7 kg ha−1a−1 ).},

abstract = {Supply of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) to the biosphere has tripled since 1960; however, little is known of how in situ response to N fertilisation differs among phytoplankton, whether species response varies with the chemical form of N, or how interpretation of N effects is influenced by the method of analysis (microscopy, pigment biomarkers). To address these issues, we conducted two 21-day in situ mesocosm (3140 L) experiments to quantify the species- and genus-specific responses of phytoplankton to fertilisation of P-rich lake waters with ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3−), and urea ([NH2]2CO). Phytoplankton abundance was estimated using both microscopic enumeration of cell densities and high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis of algal pigments. We found that total algal biomass increased 200{\%} and 350{\%} following fertilisation with NO3− and chemically-reduced N (NH4+, urea), respectively, although 144 individual taxa exhibited distinctive responses to N, including compound-specific stimulation (Planktothrix agardhii and NH4+), increased biomass with chemically-reduced N alone (Scenedesmus spp., Coelastrum astroideum) and no response (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Ceratium hirundinella). Principle components analyses (PCA) captured 53.2–69.9{\%} of variation in experimental assemblages irrespective of the degree of taxonomic resolution of analysis. PCA of species-level data revealed that congeneric taxa exhibited common responses to fertilisation regimes (e.g., Microcystis aeruginosa, M. flos-aquae, M. botrys), whereas genera within the same division had widely divergent responses to added N (e.g., Anabaena, Planktothrix, Microcystis). Least-squares regression analysis demonstrated that changes in phytoplankton biomass determined by microscopy were correlated significantly (p{\textless}0.005) with variations in HPLC-derived concentrations of biomarker pigments (r2 = 0.13–0.64) from all major algal groups, although HPLC tended to underestimate the relative abundance of cyanobacteria. Together, these findings show that while fertilisation of P-rich lakes with N can increase algal biomass, there is substantial variation in responses of genera and divisions to specific chemical forms of added N.},

abstract = {Seasonally snow-covered alpine soils may be subjected to freeze/thaw cycles, particularly during years having little snow and during the late winter and early spring periods. Freeze/thaw cycles can stimulate soil mineralization and could therefore be one factor regulating nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability and cycling. In this study laboratory incubation experiments using four soils having contrasting properties have been used to characterize the change in N and P forms (microbial and soluble inorganic/organic) that occur after simulated freeze/thaw cycles. Soil samples were collected from locations representing extreme examples of either direct human management (grazed meadow (site M) and extensive grazing beneath larch (site L)) or those disturbed by more natural events (recent avalanche and colonisation by alder (site A)) and from beneath the expected forest climax vegetation beneath fir (site F). Topsoil from these sites, maintained at two different water contents (20 and 30{\%}, w/w), were exposed to either a single (SF) or four sequential (4SF) freeze/thaw cycles. Each cycle consisted of 12h at −9°C and 12h at +4°C mimicking a diurnal pattern. A SF cycle reduced microbial N for soils from sites F and A and was accompanied by a significant increase in dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) at both moisture contents. In contrast, the microbial N of soils from M and L was not affected by the freeze/thaw cycles, suggesting a particular adaptation of soil microbes to these extremes in temperature. Freeze/thaw cycles resulted in a significant increase in the net ammonification in all soils. Extractable total dissolved N (TDN) and total dissolved P (TDP) increased in all soils after a SF cycle, however, the relative importance of the different N and P forms differed. At the lower soil moisture content, NO3− concentrations remained constant or slightly decreased in all soils, except that from site M. In all other soils DON appeared to replace NO3− as the potentially mobile N source after the freeze/thaw cycles. The relative contribution of dissolved organic P to TDP after freeze/thaw remained significant, and greater than 50{\%} in all soils. Freeze/thaw cycles, in seasonally snow covered soils, are likely to have a selective effect on the microbial biomass. Freezing and thawing resulted in a pulse of net ammonification and DON release, which represent an important influence upon N cycling in these alpine systems.},

abstract = {In arctic and alpine ecosystems, soil nitrogen (N) dynamics can differ markedly between winter and summer months, and nitrogen losses can be measurable during the spring and fall transitions. To explore the effect of seasonality on biogeochemical processes in a temperate alpine environment, we used a combination of field incubations (year-round) and N-15 tracer additions (late fall, early spring, summer) to characterize soil N dynamics in a wet and dry meadow in the Sierra Nevada, California. The snowmelt to early summer season marked a period of high N-15 uptake and turnover in the two soils, coincident with the increase in microbial N pools at the start of snowmelt (wet and dry meadow); an increase in net N mineralization and net nitrification as snowmelt progressed (wet meadow only); and measureable net production of N-15-NH4 (+) in mid-summer (wet and dry meadow). Whereas fluctuations in microbial biomass were generally synchronous between the wet and dry meadow soils, only wet meadow soils appeared to mineralize N in response to declines in the microbial N pool. Net N mineralization and net nitrification rates in the dry meadow soil were negligible on all but one sampling date, in spite of periodic decreases in biomass of up to 60{\%}. Across both sites, high N-15 recoveries in microbial biomass N, rapid N-15-NH4 (+) turnover, and low or negative net N-15-NH4 (+) fluxes suggested tight cycling of N, particularly in the late fall and early spring.},

abstract = {Proper N management is essential to prevent N losses and ensure high potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) yield and quality. Controlled-release urea (CRU) could increase nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by matching the release of N with potato N uptake. This 3-yr study conducted in Quebec, Canada, compared four treatments, namely an unfertilized control (0 N), calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) application at rates of 150 kg N ha−1 (150CAN) and 200 kg N ha−1 (200CAN), and CRU application at a rate of 150 kg N ha−1 (150CRU). The effects of treatments were assessed on potato yield, specific gravity, NUE, and chlorophyll meter readings (CMR) for two cultivars (Goldrush and Chieftain) along with soil nitrate adsorbed on anion exchange membranes (NO3AEMs). Marketable yield and the yield of jumbo and medium size classes significantly increased with N fertilization up to 150 kg N ha−1, and yields were higher with 150CRU than with 150CAN or 200CAN. Nitrogen fertilization increased CMR, but had no effect on specific gravity. The CRU continually released more nitrate during the growing season as indicated by higher NO3AEMs values, and had higher NUE compared with other treatments. Relative yield (RY) was significantly related by linear-plateau functions to CMR and NO3AEMs measured 40 to 50 d after planting, hence providing the critical values of 41.9 for CMR and 15 $\mu$g cm−2 d−1 for NO3AEMs, above which the probability of a yield response to additional N is low. Controlled-release urea is a promising N source for increasing the yield and NUE of potatoes produced in eastern Canada.},

abstract = {The heterogeneity and dynamic of water flow and solute transport processes were investigated in the upper 6m of a surficial, glacial till in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Continuous core samples from three vertical sites located over a maximum spatial distance of 65m were collected and analyzed for particle size distribution, porosity, and water content. High-resolution (0.2m) profiles of $\delta$18O and $\delta$2H in pore waters were also measured for the three sites on a seasonal basis. Depth profiles of all measured parameters indicate highly heterogeneous structures in the upper 6m. In two coreholes, depleted water isotopes measured at different depths below ground (0.7 and 3m) were in the range of winter precipitation values, suggesting preferential flow of meltwater in spring accompanied by a rising water table. A one-dimensional equilibrium flow and transport model failed to simulate the isotope-depth distributions with depleted winter values, and could not reproduce the measured values even when accounting for vertical, preferential flow. A conceptual model was created, based on the consistency of all measured data and assuming preferential lateral flow as the controlling flow and transport mechanism after snowmelt. In the model, water from surface runoff (after snowmelt) drains into an ephemeral depression that crosses the study site. As this water infiltrates, it forms a water table mound that slowly propagates away from the depression. As the water table propagates outwards, dynamic vertical flow processes result in net upward and downward fluxes.},

The RARB straddles the Canada–United States border and includes portions of two provinces and three states. This study represents the first binationally focused application of SPAtially Referenced Regressions on Watershed attributes (SPARROW) models to estimate loads and sources of TP and TN by jurisdiction and basin at multiple spatial scales. Major hurdles overcome to develop these models included: (1) harmonization of geospatial data sets, particularly construction of a contiguous stream network; and (2) use of novel calibration steps to accommodate limitations in spatial variability across the model extent and in the number of calibration sites.

abstract = {This article reviews several aspects of snow hydrochemistry: the chemistry of snowfall including chemical incorporation in snowfall and snowfall chemistry variability, the chemistry of cold, dry snowcovers including snow redistribution, snow–atmosphere chemical exchange and in-pack chemical transformations, the chemistry of wet and melting snowcovers including solute leaching, particulate interactions and microbial activity, and snow-covered basin hydrochemistry with an emphasis on nutrient chemistry. The emphasis is on the processes of chemical transformation in seasonal snowpacks and meltwaters with strong attention to the broad ecosystem view of snow chemistry rather than solely focusing on acidification effects from snowmelt. The seasonal snowcover is shown to be a dynamic hydrochemical system with strong ecological interactions. Besides wet deposition by snowfall and rain, the processes of wind redistribution, dry deposition, volatilization, crystal metamorphism, photolysis, microbial uptake and release, solute elution, and meltwater movement strongly affect the chemistry of both the snowpack and meltwaters. Snowmelt chemistry alone is rarely directly responsible for major chemical fluctuations in water bodies, but meltwater has an important role in transporting ions from soils and organic material to water bodies.},

abstract = {Abstract Global flows of reactive nitrogen (N) have increased significantly over the last century in response to agricultural intensification and elevated levels of atmospheric deposition. Despite widespread implementation conservation measures, N concentrations in surface waters are often remaining steady or continuing to increase. Although such lack of response has been attributed to time lags associated with legacy N stores in subsurface reservoirs, it is unclear what the magnitudes of such stores are and how they are partitioned between shallow soil and deeper groundwater reservoirs. Here we have synthesized data to develop a 214?year (1800?2014) trajectory of N inputs to the land surface of the continental U.S. We have concurrently developed a parsimonious, process-based model, Exploration of Long-tErM Nutrient Trajectories (ELEMeNT) that pairs this input trajectory with a travel time-based approach to simulate transport and retention along subsurface pathways. Using the model, we have reconstructed historic nitrate yields at the outlets of two major U.S. watersheds, the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) and Susquehanna River Basin (SRB). Our results show significant N loading above baseline levels in both watersheds before the widespread use of commercial N fertilizers, largely due to the conversion of forest and grassland to row crop agriculture. Model results also allow us to quantify the magnitudes of legacy N in soil and groundwater pools and to highlight the dominance of soil legacies in MRB and groundwater legacies in SRB. Approximately 55{\%} and 18{\%} of the current annual N loads in the MRB and SRB were found to be older than 10?years of age.},

The fractions of organic carbon were water-soluble carbon (WSC) and carbon mineralized under both aerobic (AMC) and anaerobic conditions (AnMC). The soils, all sampled to 5cm depth, were in three groups, from grassland in Berkshire, from grassland in Devon and from arable fields in Berkshire. Thirty-two soils were examined in field-moist condition, of which 21 were also air-dried. Contents of organic carbon ranged from 0.89 to 6.73{\%} dry soil. With the 21 air-dried soils, the highest correlations between DNP and organic carbon were with WSC (r = 0.96∗∗) and AMC (r = 0.95∗∗). When the groups of soils were considered individually, AMC generally showed rather closer correlations than did WSC with DNP. Correlations between DNP and TC (r = 0.91∗∗) or AnMC (r = 0.92∗∗) were lower than with WSC or AMC but, as with these fractions, were higher when all samples were considered together than when the groups were considered individually. With the field-moist soils, the closest correlation with DNP was given by AnMC, both when the soils were considered together (r = 0.96∗∗) and when considered in individual groups. The second closest correlation was given by AMC. The results suggest that, in the field, denitrification may often be limited by the amount of C susceptible to mineralization under anaerobic conditions.},

In the model, the landscape is divided into classes according to soil type, land use and altitude. In agricultural lands the soil is divided into three layers, each with individual computations of soil wetness and nutrient processes. The model simulates water flow and transport and turnover of nitrogen and phosphorus. Nutrients follow the same pathways as water in the model: surface runoff, macropore flow, tile drainage and outflow from individual soil layers. Rivers and lakes are described separately with routines for turnover of nutrients in each environment. Model parameters are global, or coupled to soil type or land use. The model was evaluated both by local calibrations to internal variables from different test basins and to data on discharge and nutrients from a large number of small basins. In addition, the estimated parameters were transferred to two larger basins in southern Sweden: River R{\"{o}}nne{\aa} and River Vind{\aa}n.

abstract = {An improved understanding of the fate of manure N is necessary for developing efficient manure management plans that ensure adequate crop nutrition and minimum environmental problems. This study quantified the fate of 15N-labelled liquid swine manure applied at three different times (late-fall, spring pre-plant and side-dress) on two soil types (a well-drained fine sandy loam and an imperfectly drained silt loam). Manure N uptake by corn (Zea mays L.) was significantly lower with fall application than with two spring applications (14-18{\%} vs. 30-38{\%} of applied N) in both soil types. Manure application increased total N leaching (30-43 vs. 27 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in the control), especially with fall application. Manure N contributed 18-25{\%} of the total N leached in the fine sandy loam and 8-10{\%} of the total N leached in the silt loam. Application timing did not affect manure N leaching in the silt loam, which ranged between 3 and 5{\%} of applied N. In the fine sandy loam, fall application resulted in significantly higher manure N leaching (15{\%} of applied N) than with two spring applications (8-10{\%} of applied N). Unaccounted losses, assumed to be in gaseous forms, over 6 mo following fall application were higher in the silt loam than in the fine sandy loam (29{\%} vs. 16{\%} of applied N). Estimated NH3 losses were low ({\textless}7{\%} of applied N); hence, denitrification is suggested to be the main mechanism for gaseous N losses. The estimated ratio of denitrification to leaching manure N loss for fall application was about 7:1 in the silt loam and 2:1 in the sandy loam. To maximize manure N use by corn and minimize environmental N losses, spring or side-dress application of liquid swine manure is recommended, particularly in well-drained soils.},

The soil nitrate concentration was significantly lower in the glucose-treated soil than in the filter mud or chicken manure-treated soil from days 2 and 5 to 21 of incubation. The ammonia-oxidizing bacteria community composition, measured by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, was different among the treatments 9 days after incubation, suggesting that the control soil without external fertilization had a low 283-bp (Nitrosospira) fragment relative abundance (27 {\%}) compared with the glucose-treated (62 {\%}), filter mud (73 {\%}) and chicken manure (78 {\%}) samples. Additionally, 491-bp fragments (Nitrosomonas) were detected in all the soil treatments except for the control soil, and 48-bp fragments (from different Nitrosomonas) were detected in the chicken manure-treated soil. The bacterial community structure was markedly changed in the glucose-treated soil on day 9 and in the filter mud-treated soil on day 31, indicating that the effect of filter mud on the bacterial community is delayed compared to the effect of glucose. The chicken manure-treated soil showed less change, similar to that of the control soil. Glucose fertilization greatly increased the soil bacterial abundance and functional diversity; however, the chicken manure and filter mud did not stimulate soil bacterial activity on day 9. These results indicated that nitrification may have been somewhat suppressed in the glucose-treated soils, which was possibly related to the improving ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community, bacterial community and activity via the available carbon application. The filter manure and chicken manure treatments demonstrated fewer effects. These results suggest that organic carbon quality, e.g., increasing the available carbon, regulates the nitrification process and is beneficial to reducing soil nitrogen losses.},

We reproduced the formation of capillary barriers and the development of pref-erential flow through snow using a three-dimensional water transport model, which was then validated using laboratory experiments of liquid water infiltration into layered, initially dry snow. Three-dimensional simulations assumed the same column shape and size, grain size, snow density, and water input rate as the laboratory experiments. Model evaluation focused on the timing of water movement, thickness of the upper layer affected by ponding, water content profiles and wet snow fraction. Simulation results showed that the model reconstructs relevant features of capillary barriers, including ponding in the upper layer, preferential infiltration far from the interface, and the timing of liquid water arrival at the snow base. In contrast, the area of preferential flow paths was usually underestimated and consequently the averaged water content in areas characterized by preferential flow paths was also underestimated. Improving the representation of prefer-ential infiltration into initially dry snow is necessary to re-produce the transition from a dry-snow-dominant condition to a wet-snow-dominant one, especially in long-period sim-ulations.},

abstract = {Though microbial activity is known to occur in frozen soils, little is known about the fate of animal manure N applied in the fall to agricultural soils located in areas with prolonged winter periods. Our objective was to examine transformations of soil and pig slurry N at low temperatures. Loamy and clay soils were either unamended (Control), amended with 15NH4-labeled pig slurry, or amended with the pig slurry and wheat straw. Soils were incubated at −6, −2, 2, 6, and 10 °C. The amounts of NH4, NO3 and microbial biomass N (MBN), and the presence of 15N in these pools were monitored. Total mineral N, NO3 and 15NO3 increased at temperature down to −2 °C in the loam soil and −6 °C in the clay soil, indicating that nitrification and mineralization proceeded in frozen soils. Nitrification and mineralization rates were 1.8–4.9 times higher in the clay than in the loamy soil, especially below freezing point (3.2–4.9), possibly because more unfrozen water remained in the clay than in the loamy soil. Slurry addition increased nitrification rates by 3–14 times at all temperatures, indicating that this process was N-limited even in frozen soils. Straw incorporation caused significant net N immobilization only at temperatures ≥2 °C in both soils; the rates were 1.4–3.4 higher in the loam than in the clay soil. Nevertheless, up to 30{\%} of the applied 15N was present in MBN at all temperatures. These findings indicate that microbial N immobilization occurred in frozen soils, but was not strong enough to induce net immobilization below the freezing point, even in the presence of straw. The Q10 values for estimated mineralization and nitrification rates were one to two orders-of-magnitude larger below 2 °C than above this temperature (13–208 versus 1.5–6.9, respectively), indicating that these processes are highly sensitive to a small increase in soil temperature around the freezing point of water. This study confirms that net mineralization and nitrification can occur at potentially significant rates in frozen agricultural soils, especially in the presence of organic amendments. In contrast, net N immobilization could be detected essentially above the freezing point. Our results imply that fall-applied N could be at risk of overwinter losses, particularly in fine-textured soils.},

abstract = {Relieving phosphorus loading is a key management tool for controlling Lake Erie eutrophication. During the 1960s and 1970s, increased phosphorus inputs degraded water quality and reduced central basin hypolimnetic oxygen levels which, in turn, eliminated thermal habitat vital to cold-water organisms and contributed to the extirpation of important benthic macroinvertebrate prey species for fishes. In response to load reductions initiated in 1972, Lake Erie responded quickly with reduced water-column phosphorus concentrations, phytoplankton biomass, and bottom-water hypoxia (dissolved oxygen {\textless}2mg/l). Since the mid-1990s, cyanobacteria blooms increased and extensive hypoxia and benthic algae returned. We synthesize recent research leading to guidance for addressing this re-eutrophication, with particular emphasis on central basin hypoxia. We document recent trends in key eutrophication-related properties, assess their likely ecological impacts, and develop load response curves to guide revised hypoxia-based loading targets called for in the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Reducing central basin hypoxic area to levels observed in the early 1990s (ca. 2000km2) requires cutting total phosphorus loads by 46{\%} from the 2003–2011 average or reducing dissolved reactive phosphorus loads by 78{\%} from the 2005–2011 average. Reductions to these levels are also protective of fish habitat. We provide potential approaches for achieving those new loading targets, and suggest that recent load reduction recommendations focused on western basin cyanobacteria blooms may not be sufficient to reduce central basin hypoxia to 2000km2.},

abstract = {The development of an infiltration model for frozen soils and its application for predicting streamflow from snowmelt in a prairie environment is addressed. The model assumes that frozen soils can be grouped into three broad classes according to their infiltration potential. The first of these is ' Unlimited, ' which are cracked or highly porous soils capable of infiltrating all of the snow water. The second class is ' Limited ' where the infiltration potential of a soil depends primarily on the snow cover water equivalent and the ice content of the soil layer, 0-33 mm at the time of the melt. The third class is ' Restricted , ' a soil containing and impermeable layer that inhibits infiltration. Field measurements of soil water changes during snow cover ablation are used to support the concept and a prediction equation for soils of ' Limited ' potential is described. Estimates of infiltration qualities and runoff volumes determined by the model are compared with corresponding estimates which were either observed or calculated by a mass balance analysis of data collected on areas ranging in size from 35 sq m to 11.4 sq km. The agreement in values suggest that the model is capable of giving estimates of areal infiltration of acceptable accuracy for operational purposes. It is demonstrated that the performance of the NWSRFS (National Weather Service River Forecast System) and the SSARR (Streamflow Simulation and Reservoir Regulation) operational models in simulating streamflow from snowmelt on a prairie watershed is markedly improved with the use of the infiltration algorithm.

abstract = {The P-supplying power of the fine-textured soils from Abitibi-Temiscaming (Quebec, Canada) has never been investigated. Anion exchange membranes (AEM), the electro-ultrafiltration (EUF) technique and chemical extractions were used to describe their P status. Phosphorus was desorbed from four soils that had received 52.4 kg P ha–1 yr–1 from 1994 to 1996 and from unfertilized soils. The cumulative amount of P desorbed in 75 min by EUF from unfertilized soils varied from 10 to 69 mg P kg–1. Averaged over all sites and treatments, the amount of soil P extracted by different methods ranged from 1.0 to 18.9 mg P kg–1. The cumulative grass P uptake was significantly related to P desorbed by all methods (0.39 {\textless} r {\textless} 0.84). A close relationship between grass P uptake and PAEMs indicated the adequacy of the AEMs to determine plant-available P in Abitibi-Temiscaming soils. A high degree of linearity (0.97 {\textless} R2 {\textless} 0.99) of the EUF-P desorption curves at 200 V and 20°C with time was obtained. This indicates that soils h...},

abstract = {A study conducted in 1994 as part of the US Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program, South Platte River Basin investigation, examined the effect of certain environmental factors on potential denitrification rates in nitrate-rich riverbed sediments. The acetylene block technique was used to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) production rates in laboratory incubations of riverbed sediments to evaluate the effect of varying nitrate concentrations, organic carbon concentrations and type, and water temperature on potential denitrification rates. Sediment incubations amended with nitrate, at concentrations ranging from 357 to 2142 $\mu$mol l−1 (as measured in the field), produced no significant increase (P {\textgreater} 0.05) in N2O production rates, indicating that the denitrification potential in these sediments was not nitrate limited. In contrast, incubations amended with acetate as a source of organic carbon, at concentrations ranging from 0 to 624 $\mu$mol l−1, produced significant increases (P {\textless} 0.05) in N2O production rates with increased organic carbon concentration, indicating that the denitrification potential in these sediments was organic carbon limited. Furthermore, N2O production rates also were affected by the type of organic carbon available as an electron donor. Acetate and surface-water-derived fulvic acid supported higher N2O production rates than groundwater-derived fulvic acid or sedimentary organic carbon. Lowering incubation temperatures from 22 to 4°C resulted in about a 77{\%} decrease in the N2O production rates. These results help to explain findings from previous studies indicating that only 15–30{\%} of nitrate in groundwater was denitrified before discharging to the South Platte River and that nitrate concentrations in the river generally were higher in winter than in summer.},

The grain boundaries in highly unsaturated snow (up to about 7{\%} liquid by volume with small applied loads are stable and the grains must be arranged in clusters to achieve local force equilibrium. Two grains bond together with geometrical constraints on the radii of the phase boundaries. Three grains join at a liquid vein whose size is determined by grain size and capillary pressure (i.e., liquid “tension”. Slow grain growth occurs by sublimation, vapor diffusion, and condensation and intergrain strength is relatively high.

abstract = {Nonpoint source pollution of surface water by nitrate from agricultural activities is a national problem. An agricultural watershed in the Iowa Loess Hills with a 23-year history of annual corn production with average N fertilization is studied. Headcut seepage is transported through a natural riparian zone and observed as weir baseflow; surface runoff is measured separately. Nitrate runoff graphs illustrate the importance of high-frequency sampling of each event to permit quantitative estimation of chemical loss. The concentration of nitrate carried from the field in basin drainage steadily increased from {\textless}1 mg L-1 in 1969 to {\textgreater}20 mg L-1 in 1991. The rate of cumulative increase in the amount of applied N is greater than the rate of removal by the crop. Over the 23-year record, 23{\%} of the mean annual application of N remains stored and available for leaching or chemical conversion by soil microbes. Nitrate removal during early spring snowmelt surface runoff shows a diurnal pattern that corresponds to the daily freezing and thawing of the surface soil in early March. Contribution to the load of nitrate deposited on the soil surface by rainfall is very small in comparison to the amount applied by fertilizer application. Measurable changes in water quality within various hydrogeologic compartments are seldom observed in just a few years of monitoring. Therefore, these results emphasize the importance of long-term data sets incorporating temporal variability when evaluating the impact of agricultural practices on surface water resources.},

abstract = {Eutrophication of shallow freshwater lakes is a severe ecological problem all over the world. Phosphorus is one of the main triggering nutrients responsible for eutrophication of shallow freshwater lakes. Constructed wetlands provide an effective means of phosphorus removal from enriched waters. The cost of a constructed wetland depends mainly on the substrates filled within it. Here we used three inexpensive substrates including loess, cinder and limestone to construct a wetland along the shore of Lake Taihu, and then tested the total phosphorus (TP) removal ability of the wetland, the chemical and physical characteristics, and the abilities of phosphorus adsorption and inhibition of substrates. We found that the artificial wetland constructed with layered loess, cinder, and limestone but without hydrophytes and mesophytes had high phosphorus removal ability during the 44-day test, especially in the first 10 days. The average removal rate for TP was 41{\%} for the overall testing time. Chemical properties of the substrates had stronger impacts on phosphorus removal than physical properties did. Among the three substrates, limestone had the highest phosphorus removal and inhibition ability due to its highest calcium content. This suggests that more attention should be paid to chemical composition during the selection and assembly of substrates for both constructed wetland study and its engineering applications.},

The RKT is a robust, nonparametric test that provides an increased power of trend detection by grouping data from multiple sites within a given geographic region. The RKT analyses indicated strong, pervasive trends in snowmelt and streamflow timing, which have shifted toward earlier in the year by a median of 2–3 weeks over the 29-yr study period. In contrast, relatively few statistically significant trends were detected using simple linear regression. RKT analyses also indicated that November–May air temperatures increased by a median of 0.9°C decade−1, while 1 April SWE and maximum SWE declined by a median of 4.1 and 3.6 cm decade−1, respectively. Multiple linear regression models were created, using monthly air temperatures, snowfall, latitude, and elevation as explanatory variables to identify major controlling factors on snowmelt timing. The models accounted for 45{\%} of the variance in snowmelt onset, and 78{\%} of the variance in the snowmelt center of mass (when half the snowpack had melted). Variations in springtime air temperature and SWE explained most of the interannual variability in snowmelt timing. Regression coefficients for air temperature were negative, indicating that warm temperatures promote early melt. Regression coefficients for SWE, latitude, and elevation were positive, indicating that abundant snowfall tends to delay snowmelt, and snowmelt tends to occur later at northern latitudes and high elevations. Results from this study indicate that even the mountains of Colorado, with their high elevations and cold snowpacks, are experiencing substantial shifts in the timing of snowmelt and snowmelt runoff toward earlier in the year.

Although most mortalities were coincident with low pH and elevated inorganic Al concentrations, the high survival (82{\%}) demonstrated that under natural conditions most sac fry could tolerate pH{\textless}5.0 and inorganic Al concentrations of 40-50 ug/L for at least 5 d.

abstract = {SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) is a conceptual, continuous time model that was developed in the early 1990s to assist water resource managers in assessing the impact of management and climate on water supplies and non-point source pollution in watersheds and large river basins. SWAT is the continuation of over 30 years of model development within the US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service and was developed to 'scale up' past field-scale models to large river basins. Model components include weather, hydrology, erosion/sedimentation, plant growth, nutrients, pesticides, agricultural management, stream routing and pond/reservoir routing. The latest version, SWAT2000, has several significant enhancements that include: bacteria transport routines; urban routines; Green and Ampt infiltration equation; improved weather generator; ability to read in daily solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed and potential ET; Muskingum channel routing; and modified dormancy calculations for tropical areas. A complete set of model documentation for equations and algorithms, a user manual describing model inputs and outputs, and an ArcView interface manual are now complete for SWAT2000. The model has been recoded into Fortran 90 with a complete data dictionary, dynamic allocation of arrays and modular subroutines. Current research is focusing on bacteria, riparian zones, pothole topography, forest growth, channel downcutting and widening, and input uncertainty analysis. The model SWAT is meanwhile used in many countries all over the world. Recent developments in European Environmental Policy, such as the adoption of the European Water Framework directive in December 2000, demand tools for integrative river basin management. The model SWAT is applicable for this purpose. It is a flexible model that can be used under a wide range of different environmental conditions, as this special issue will show. The papers compiled here are the result of the first International SWAT Conference held in August 2001 in Rauischholzhausen, Germany. More than 50 participants from 14 countries discussed their modelling experiences with the model development team from the USA. Nineteen selected papers with issues reaching from the newest developments, the evaluation of river basin management, interdisciplinary approaches for river basin management, the impact of land use change, methodical aspects and models derived from SWAT are published in this special issue.

However, monitoring of the water quality within the marshland indicates that the contaminant level has not yet surpassed the background concentration values downstream from the main impacted area. A mathematical modelling procedure was developed in an attempt to predict the mobility of several contaminant species within the marshland environment. Parameters needed for the predictive model were gathered based on the physical configuration of the landfill and marshland as well as associated laboratory-derived data on the attenuation capacity of the marshland soil matrix. A multidimensional finite-difference model based on the Advection-Dispersion equation was used to predict migration of the contaminants. The model was adapted to the hydrologic characteristics of the marshland, emphasizing groundwater flow, dilution and the adsorption capacity of the organic soil. The surface water flow in the marshland was assumed to be at the marshland surface, i.e. only the groundwater flow in the organic soil layer was considered in this investigation. Modelling results indicate that marshland soil has the capacity to substantially retard the migration of several contaminant species typically found in landfill leachate.},

In 1977, a persistent snow cover developed in the watershed by 1 December, and snow accumulation was near normal for this region. In 1980, persistent snow cover did not develop until mid-January, and the final snowpack was well below average. Between years, major differences in the timing of ion export were found for calcium, magnesium, and sodium, ions which appear to be associated with the watershed's soils. Conversely, potassium, a cation not as strongly associated with soil ion sources, showed temporal patterns of export which were similar in timing during the two years. We hypothesize that concrete soil frost, which developed in 1980 as a consequence of the late-developing snow cover, strongly influenced the timing of ion export by isolating early spring runoff from the watershed's soils.

abstract = {Differences in the simulation of hydrologic processes by watershed models directly affect the accuracy of results. Surface runoff generation can be simulated as either: (1) infiltration-excess (or Hortonian) overland flow, or (2) saturation-excess overland flow. This study compared the Hydrological Simulation Program—FORTRAN (HSPF) and the Soil Moisture Routing (SMR) models, each representing one of these mechanisms. These two models were applied to a 102 km2 watershed in the upper part of the Irondequoit Creek basin in central New York State over a seven-year simulation period. The models differed in both the complexity of simulating snowmelt and baseflow processes as well as the detail in which the geographic information was preserved by each model. Despite their differences in structure and representation of hydrologic processes, the two models simulated streamflow with almost equal accuracy. Since streamflow is an integral response and depends mainly on the watershed water balance, this was not unexpected. Model efficiency values for the seven-year simulation period were 0.67 and 0.65 for SMR and HSPF, respectively. HSPF simulated winter streamflow slightly better than SMR as a result of its complex snowmelt routine, whereas SMR simulated summer flows better than HSPF as a result of its runoff and baseflow processes. An important difference between model results was the ability to predict the spatial distribution of soil moisture content. HSPF aggregates soil moisture content, which is generally related to a specific pervious land unit across the entire watershed, whereas SMR predictions of moisture content distribution are geographically specific and matched field observations reasonably well. Important is that the saturated area was predicted well by SMR and confirmed the validity of using saturation-excess mechanisms for this hillslope dominated watershed.},

The potential for a range of 11 residue types to release nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) was assessed by snowmelt simulation. Interactions between soils and residues were measured for two contrasting residues. Samples (taken in late fall) were frozen prior to snowmelt simulations that consisted of three diurnal temperature cycles from −5°C to +9°C followed by a final melt at +5°C. Releases of total and total dissolved P (TP and TDP), total dissolved N (TDN), and dissolved organic C (DOC) during simulated snowmelt were greater from actively growing residues than from crop stubble and were significantly related to plant moisture and nutrient contents.

abstract = {Understanding the fate of applied nitrogen (N) in agricultural soils is important for agronomic, environmental, and human health reasons, but it is methodologically difficult to study at the field scale. Natural abundance stable isotope measurements ($\delta$15N) were used in this field study with micrometeorological measurements of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to identify the biogeochemical processes responsible for rapid N transformations immediately after application of liquid dairy manure. Fifteen samplings occurred between 16 Mar. 2012 and 5 Apr. 2013, with a focus on spring manure application (before and after) and a winter snowmelt period. Concentrations and $\delta$15N values of ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3−), N2O, and total N were measured throughout the year. Approximately 56 (±7){\%} of the NH4+–N applied in the spring could not be accounted for 3 d after manure application and was presumably lost by ammonia volatilization before it was tilled into the soil and/or removed from the inorganic N pool by microbial assimilation. Almost all of the remaining manure-NH4+ (95 ± 1.1{\%}) was converted within 3 wk to NO3− and N2O by nitrification and nitrifier-denitrification, respectively. The in situ 15N isotope effect for nitrification ($\epsilon$Nitrate–Ammonium) was calculated to be −32.0 (±5.3)‰. Overall, field-scale measurements of $\delta$15N at natural abundance provided valuable information that was used to distinguish sources of NH4+ (manure vs. soil organic N) and to follow the production and consumption of NO3− and the pathways of N2O production in soil.},

abstract = {We studied the annual N2O emissions from boreal dairy pastures in Eastern Finland. The N2O emissions were measured with a chamber technique from a timothy–meadow fescue sward with mineral N fertilization and from a grass–white clover sward without fertilization. The simulated dung and urine patches were applied either in June or August during two grazing seasons. The measurements were carried out 1 year after applications after the first season and continued for another year after the second season to measure possible after-effects. The annual N2O-N emissions from the grass sward varied between 3.2 and 4.1kgha−1 and from the grass–clover sward between 6.4 and 7.6kgha−1. The N2O-N emission from the grass pastures expressed as a proportion of the applied N was 0.6–1.4{\%} for the control plots (without excreta), 0.4–0.9{\%} for the urine and 0.7–4.5{\%} for the dung-treated areas. After 1 year the N2O emissions from the urine or dung plots did not differ from those from the untreated control plots. The time of application of the excreta had a minor effect on the emissions. The accumulation of N2O in the soil was measured from the control and treatment plots during winter and the release of accumulated N2O during the thaw contributed to the high emissions in spring. Winter-time N2O emissions were 25–78{\%} of the annual total indicating the importance of the cold period in the annual N2O emissions in boreal regions. In conclusion, the magnitude of the annual N2O emissions was rather similar to that from temperate pastures despite the large differences in climatic factors and the dynamics of N2O emissions.},

The Integrated Catchments Model for Mercury (INCA-Hg) simulates transport of gaseous, dissolved and solid Hg and transformations between elemental (Hg 0), ionic (Hg(II)) and methyl (MeHg) Hg in natural and semi-natural landscapes. The mathematical description represents the model as a series of linked, first-order differential equations describing chemical and hydrological processes in catchment soils and waters which we believe control surface water Hg dynamics. The model simulates daily time series between one and 100years long and can be applied to catchments ranging in size from {\textless}1 to {\~{}}10,000km 2. Here we present applications of the model to two boreal forest headwater catchments in central Canada where we were able to reproduce observed patterns of stream water total mercury (THg) and MeHg fluxes and concentrations. Model performance was assessed using Monte Carlo techniques. Simulated in-stream THg and MeHg concentrations were sensitive to hydrologic controls and terrestrial and aquatic process rates. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Tn determine how soil frost changes flowpaths of runoff water along a hillslope, a transect consisting of four soil profiles directed towards a small stream in a mature forest stand was investigated at Svartberget, near Vindeln in northern Sweden. Soil temperature, unfrozen water content, groundwater level and snow depth were investigated along the transect, which started at the riparian peat, and extended 30 m upslope into mineral soils. The two, more organic-rich profiles closest to the stream had higher water retention and wetter autumn conditions than the sandy mineral soils further upslope, The organic content of the soil influenced the variation in frost along the transect. The first winter (1995-96) had abnormally low snow precipitation, which gave a deep frost down to 40-80 cm, whereas the two following winters had frost depths of 5-20 cm. During winter 1995-96, the two organic profiles close to the stream had a shallower frost depth than tile mineral soil profile higher upslope, but a considerably larger amount of frozen water. The fraction of water that did not freeze despite several minus degrees in the soil was 5-7 vol.{\%} in the mineral soil and 10-15 vol.{\%} in the organic soil. From the measurements there were no signs of perched water tables during any of the three snowmelt periods, which would have been strong evidence for changed water flowpaths due to soil frost. When shallow soil layers became saturated during snowmelt, especially in 1997 and 1998, it was because of rising groundwater levels. Several rain on frozen ground events during spring 1996 resulted in little runoff, since most of the rain either froze in the soil or filled up the soil water storage.

abstract = {Knowledge of changes in spatial and temporal distributions of actual evaporation would be useful for land surface parameterizations in the Prairie region of Canada. Yet challenges persist for examining the variability of evaporation from land surfaces and vegetation over such a large region. This is due in part to the existence of numerous methods of varying complexity for obtaining estimates of evaporation and a general lack of sufficient measurements to drive detailed models. Integrated approaches may be applied for distributing evaporation over vast regions using energy and mass balance methods that integrate remote sensing imagery and surface reference data. Whilst informative, previous studies have not considered the variability of actual evaporation under drought and above normal moisture conditions. Continuous physically-based simulations were conducted for a 46year period using the Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM) platform. The Penman–Monteith model was applied in this platform to calculate estimates of actual evaporation at point locations which had sufficient hourly measurements. Variations in the statistical properties and mapped distributions derived from point-scale modelling via CRHM were instructional for understanding how evaporation varied spatially and temporally for a baseline normal period (1971–2000) and the years 1999–2005 which included both drought and above normal moisture conditions. The modelling approach was applied successfully for examining the historical variability of evaporation and can be applied to constrain land surface parameterization schemes; validate more empirical predictive model outputs; inform operational agrometeorological and hydrological applications in the Canadian Prairies.},

@article{Quinton1999,
abstract = {Hillslope runoff processes were studied in the tundra region of the Canadian western arctic in order to provide a physically-based, conceptual framework for runoff generation for basins in this environment. It was found that subsurface flow is the dominant mechanism of runoff to the stream channel, that this flow is conveyed predominantly through the peat of the inter-hummock channels, and that subsurface flow through the highly conductive upper peat layer and soil pipes can be as rapid as surface flow. Stream discharge was computed from computations of hillslope runoff and meltwater input from the snowpack in the stream channel. The similarity between the computed and measured stream discharge suggests that the approach used to compute discharge would be useful as a conceptual basis for a distributed hydrological model for this environment. Hydrological interaction among the basin subsystems was found to play an important role in runoff generation. For example, when the water table was in the highly conductive upper peat layer, and discharge from inter-hummock channels was relatively large (∽0{\textperiodcentered}1–1{\textperiodcentered}0 m3 d−1), the near-stream area, a zone of relatively thick peat, offered little attenuation to water draining toward the stream channel, and the source area for stream flow was relatively large. The duration of this high flow regime varied among hillsides due to variations in the width of the near-stream area, the gradient, length and inclination of hillslopes, and the water equivalent and melt rate of the snowpack. When the water table subsided into the lower peat layer, and discharge from inter-hummock channels decreased ({\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}1 m3 d−1), the runoff source area was relatively small. Under this condition, if drainage into the near-stream area increased, the lateral expansion of the runoff source area would be delayed due to the relatively large storage capacity near the stream.

In these catchments, the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model can help better understand the problems related to diffuse pollution. The numerous documented applications of SWAT have been dominated by areas uniquely driven by rainfall. Given that Canadian hydroclimatic conditions differ due to the presence of a seasonal snowpack of long duration, evaluation of the hydrological performance needs to be performed prior to attempting any water quality simulations. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the hydrological behaviour of the SWAT model under snowmelt and rainfall for two small watersheds located in southeastern Canada. Different calibration schemes are evaluated including seasonal effects. One-year calibration gave satisfactory daily performances measured with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) ranging between 61 and 83{\%} and deviations of volume (Dv ) between −10 and 1{\%}, while in validation, NS w...},

The contributors describe the fundamental physical and small-scale chemical processes that characterize the evolution of snow and their influence on the life cycles of true snow organisms and the biota of cold regions with extended snow cover. The book further expands on the role of snow in the biosphere by the study of the relationship between snow and climate and the paleo-ecological evidence for the influence of past snow regimes on plant communities. Snow Ecology will form a main textbook on advanced courses in biology, ecology, geography, environmental science, and earth science where an important component is devoted to the study of the cryosphere.

abstract = {After a programme of integrated field and modelling research, hydrological processes of considerable uncertainty such as snow redistribution by wind, snow interception, sublimation, snowmelt, infiltration into frozen soils, hillslope water movement over permafrost, actual evaporation, and radiation exchange to complex surfaces have been described using physically based algorithms. The cold regions hydrological model (CRHM) platform, a flexible object-oriented modelling system was devised to incorporate these algorithms and others and to connect them for purposes of simulating the cold regions hydrological cycle over small to medium sized basins. Landscape elements in CRHM can be linked episodically in process-specific cascades via blowing snow transport, overland flow, organic layer subsurface flow, mineral interflow, groundwater flow, and streamflow. CRHM has a simple user interface but no provision for calibration; parameters and model structure are selected based on the understanding of the hydrological system; as such the model can be used both for prediction and for diagnosis of the adequacy of hydrological understanding. The model is described and demonstrated in basins from the semi-arid prairie to boreal forest, mountain and muskeg regions of Canada where traditional hydrological models have great difficulty in describing hydrological phenomena. Some success is shown in simulating various elements of the hydrological cycle without calibration; this is encouraging for predicting hydrology in ungauged basins.

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) losses from agricultural landscapes arise from the interaction of hydrologic, edaphic, and management factors, complicated by their spatial and temporal variability. We monitored sites along two agricultural hillslopes to assess the eff ects of fi eld management and hydrology on P transfers in surface runoff at diff erent landscape positions. Surface runoff varied by landscape position, with saturation excess runoff accounting for 19 times the volume of infi ltration excess runoff at the north footslope position, but infi ltration excess runoff dominated at upslope landscape positions. Runoff diff ered signifi cantly between south and north footslopes, coinciding with the extent of upslope soil underlain by a fragipan. Phosphorus in runoff was predominantly in dissolved reactive form (70{\%}), with the highest concentrations associated with upper landscape positions closest to fi elds serving as major sources of P. However, the largest loads of P were from the north footslope, where runoff volumes were 24 times larger than from all other sites combined. Loads of P from the north footslope appeared to be primarily chronic transfers of desorbed soil P. Although runoff from the footslope likely contributed directly to stream fl ow and hence to stream water quality, 27{\%} of runoff P from the upslope sites did not connect directly with stream fl ow. Findings of this study will be useful for evaluating the critical source area concept and metrics such as the P-Index.},

abstract = {Assessment of the soil N supply capacity is essential to optimize fertilizer N use. We investigated soil N supply capacity and fertilizer N recovery for three cropping systems established in 1977: silage corn (Zea mays L.)–cereal without (CC) and with 20 Mg ha−1 yr−1 manure (CCM), and silage corn–forage (3-yr) with manure (CFM). During the present study (2005–2008), manure applications were suspended and a silage corn–silage corn–barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.)–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) sequence was imposed to all systems. Fertilizer (15NH4 15NO3, 3.1 atom {\%} 15N) was applied in 2005 to silage corn (160 kg N ha−1) and in 2007 to barley (80 kg N ha−1). The 15N recovery in silage corn and barley ranged from 40 to 59{\%}, with the lowest values measured in CFM. Compared to the CC systems (47 kg N ha−1) in 2005, soil-derived N in silage corn was two times higher under CCM (98 kg N ha−1), and four times higher under CFM (208 kg N ha−1). These differences decreased over years, but were still noticeable at the end of the experiment. Twenty-two to 58{\%} of applied 15N was recovered in the soil at harvest. More than 50{\%} of this residual N was present in macroaggregates ({\textgreater}0.25 mm), whereas {\textless}20{\%} was present in particulate organic matter (POM). Up to 75{\%} of residual 15N was lost during the winter period, and little residual N was transferred to the following crop. These findings indicate that soil macroaggregates may be a preferential sink for residual fertilizer N, but this N is not present in stable forms and is vulnerable to environmental loss.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} It is well established that the Earth's climate system has warmed significantly over the past several decades, and in association there have been widespread changes in various other Earth system components. This has been especially prevalent in the cold regions of the northern mid- to high latitudes. Examples of these changes can be found within the western and northern interior of Canada, a region that exemplifies the scientific and societal issues faced in many other similar parts of the world, and where impacts have global-scale consequences. This region has been the geographic focus of a large amount of previous research on changing climatic, cryospheric, and hydrological regimes in recent decades, while current initiatives such as the Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN) introduced in this review seek to further develop the understanding and diagnosis of this change and hence improve the capacity to predict future change. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the observed changes in various Earth system components and a concise and up-to-date regional picture of some of the temporal trends over the interior of western Canada since the mid- or late 20th century. The focus is on air temperature, precipitation, seasonal snow cover, mountain glaciers, permafrost, freshwater ice cover, and river discharge. Important long-term observational networks and data sets are described, and qualitative linkages among the changing components are highlighted. Increases in air temperature are the most notable changes within the domain, rising on average 2{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}°C throughout the western interior since 1950. This increase in air temperature is associated with hydrologically important changes to precipitation regimes and unambiguous declines in snow cover depth, persistence, and spatial extent. Consequences of warming air temperatures have caused mountain glaciers to recede at all latitudes, permafrost to thaw at its southern limit, and active layers over permafrost to thicken. Despite these changes, integrated effects on stream flow are complex and often offsetting. Following a review of the current literature, we provide insight from a network of northern research catchments and other sites detailing how climate change confounds hydrological responses at smaller scales, and we recommend several priority research areas that will be a focus of continued work in CCRN. Given the complex interactions and process responses to climate change, it is argued that further conceptual understanding and quantitative diagnosis of the mechanisms of change over a range of scales is required before projections of future change can be made with confidence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Abstract: The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been applied successfully in temperate environments but little is known about its performance in the snow-dominated, forested, mountainous watersheds that provide much of the water supply in western North America. To address this knowledge gap, we configured SWAT to simulate the streamflow of Tenderfoot Creek (TCSWAT). Located in central Montana, TCSWAT represents a high-elevation watershed with 223C85{\%} coniferous forest cover where more than 70{\%} of the annual precipitation falls as snow, and runoff comes primarily from spring snowmelt. Model calibration using four years of measured daily streamflow, temperature, and precipitation data resulted in a relative error (RE) of 2{\%} for annual water yield estimates, and mean paired deviations (Dv) of 36 and 31{\%} and Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiencies of 0.90 and 0.86 for monthly and daily streamflow, respectively. Model validation was conducted using an additional four years of data and the performance was similar to the calibration period, with RE of 4{\%} for annual water yields, Dv of 43{\%} and 32{\%}, and NS efficiencies of 0.90 and 0.76 for monthly and daily streamflow, respectively. An objective, regression-based model invalidation procedure also indicated that the model was validated for the overall simulation period. Seasonally, SWAT performed well during the spring and early summer snowmelt runoff period, but was a poor predictor of late summer and winter base flow. The calibrated model was most sensitive to snowmelt parameters, followed in decreasing order of influence by the surface runoff lag, ground water, soil, and SCS Curve Number parameter sets. Model sensitivity to the surface runoff lag parameter reflected the influence of frozen soils on runoff processes. Results indicated that SWAT can provide reasonable predictions of annual, monthly, and daily streamflow from forested montane watersheds, but further model refinements could improve representation of snowmelt runoff processes and performance during the base flow period in this environment.},

abstract = {Polymer-coated urea (PCU) is used in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production to maintain or improve tuber yield while minimizing N losses, but the mode of N release is different from conventional soluble N sources. Hence, it is not known how soil- and plant-based indices of N availability would perform in response to PCU application. A 3-yr study was conducted on a sandy-loam soil in Quebec, Canada, to examine the effect of PCU application rate (0, 60, 120, 200, and 280 kg N ha–1) on petiole NO3–N concentrations, chlorophyll meter readings (SPAD readings), soil mineral N content, and total tuber yield. Nitrate availability throughout the growing season was monitored by measuring NO3 adsorbed by anion exchange membranes (NO3AEM). The NO3AEM values, petiole NO3–N concentrations, SPAD readings, soil mineral N content, and total tuber yield increased with PCU application rate. The NO3AEM values fluctuated during the growing season due to plant N uptake and variations in soil moisture content. Using all the PCU rates across years, we found that relative yield was better related to petiole NO3–N concentrations measured at 45 to 50 d after planting (DAP) (R2 = 0.95) and to cumulative NO3AEM values measured up to 49 DAP (R2 = 0.91) than soil mineral N (R2 = 0.67), soil NO3–N (R2 = 0.65), and SPAD readings (R2 = 0.53) measured at 45 to 50 DAP, respectively. This study showed that soil- and plant-based indices of N availability can be used as early indicators of yield response in potato fertilized with PCU.},

@article{Delmas1996,
abstract = {The chemistry of precipitation (snow and rainfall), snow cover and meltwaters was studied at a French alpine site during the winter-spring seasons of 1986–1987 and 1987–1988. Both acid ( {\textless} pH 5.6) and alkaline ( {\textgreater} pH 5.6) deposition events occurred. The strong-acid anions, SO4 and BO3, contributed to the acidity of precipitation but NO3 was the principal anion associated with acidic snowfall. Many alkaline snowfalls are associated with airborne calcareous dusts from regional sources. The most alkaline snowfall, however, was associated with dust from the Sahara Desert. The weathering of dusts in the snow cover during melt leads to the consumption of acidity and an increase in the pH of meltwaters. The results of both field and laboratory experiments show that inputs of calcareous dusts by local aeolian erosion and transport can contribute significantly to the neutralization process. The laboratory experiments also show that the size and distribution of dusts in the snow cover have an effect on the degree of neutralization. Dust in the lower strata of snow cover is more efficient in neutralizing the acidity of meltwaters than dust in the upper strata. The relationship between the distribution of dust and its efficiency to neutralize the acidity of meltwaters can be explained by the kinetics of calcite dissolution under conditions of progressive decreases in the acidity of leached snow and the partial pressures of CO2 within the snow column during the melt process.},

abstract = {Data of liquid water flow around a capillary bar-rier in snow are still limited. To gain insight into this pro-cess, we carried out observations of dyed water infiltration in layered snow at 0 • C during cold laboratory experiments. We considered three different finer-over-coarser textures and three different water input rates. By means of visual inspec-tion, horizontal sectioning, and measurements of liquid water content (LWC), capillary barriers and associated preferential flow were characterized. The flow dynamics of each sample were also simulated solving the Richards equation within the 1-D multi-layer physically based snow cover model SNOW-PACK. Results revealed that capillary barriers and preferen-tial flow are relevant processes ruling the speed of water in-filtration in stratified snow. Both are marked by a high de-gree of spatial variability at centimeter scale and complex 3-D patterns. During unsteady percolation of water, observed peaks in bulk volumetric LWC at the interface reached ∼ 33– 36 vol {\%} when the upper layer was composed by fine snow (grain size smaller than 0.5 mm). However, LWC might lo-cally be greater due to the observed heterogeneity in the pro-cess. Spatial variability in water transmission increases with grain size, whereas we did not observe a systematic depen-dency on water input rate for samples containing fine snow. The comparison between observed and simulated LWC pro-files revealed that the implementation of the Richards equa-tion reproduces the existence of a capillary barrier for all observed cases and yields a good agreement with observed peaks in LWC at the interface between layers.},

abstract = {A new in-stream model of phosphorus (P) and macrophyte dynamics, the Kennet Model, was applied to a reach of the River Kennet to investigate the impacts of changing flow conditions on macrophyte growth. The investigation was based on the assessment of two flow change scenarios, which both included the simulation of decreasing total phosphorus concentrations from a sewage treatment works due to improved effluent treatment. In the first scenario, the precipitation and potential evaporation outputs from a climate change model (HadCM2 GGx) where input into the catchment model INCA to predict the mean daily flows in the reach. In the second scenario, the mean daily flows observed in a historically dry year were repeated as input to the in-stream model to simulate an extended low flow period over 2 years. The simulation results suggest that changes in the seasonal distribution of flow were not detrimental to macrophyte growth. However, the simulation of extended periods of low flow suggests that a proliferation of epiphytic algae occurs, even when the in-stream phosphorus concentrations are reduced due to effluent treatment. This epiphytic growth was predicted to reduce the macrophyte peak biomass within the reach by approximately 80{\%}. Thus, the model simulations suggest that flow was more important in controlling the macrophyte biomass in the River Kennet, than the in-stream phosphorus concentrations, which are elevated due to agricultural diffuse sources. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {During the past decade, significant spatial and temporal variability in the release of nitrate-nitrogen (N) from catchments in a sugar maple forest in central Ontario was observed. To explain this variability, we tested the flushing hypothesis [Hornberger et al., 1994], where, when the soil saturation deficit is high, N accumulates in the upper layers of the soil and, as the soil saturation deficit decreases, the formation of a saturated subsurface layer flushes N from the upper layers of the soil into the stream. We used the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System to simulate water, carbon, and N dynamics. A N flushing index was modeled as S/S30, the ratio of the current day saturation deficit to the previous 30-day average saturation deficit. A N source index was modeled as the ratio of N supply/demand. The relationship between the simulated N indices and the observed release of N indicated two mechanisms for the release of N from catchments: (1) a N flushing mechanism, where the N-enriched upper layer of the soil is flushed, after a period of low demand for N by the forest (e.g., during spring snowmelt and autumn stormflow, the water table rising into previously unsaturated parts of a N-enriched soil profile) or after a period of high demand for N by the forest (e.g., during summer droughts, the water table rising into previously saturated parts of a N-impoverished soil profile following a period of enhanced rates of nitrification); and (2) a N draining mechanism, where spring snowmelt recharge of the groundwater translocates N from the upper layer of the soil into deeper hydrological flow pathways that are released slowly over the year.},

The climate of cold regions might play an important role in disturbing environmental behavior of NPS N and P, influencing simulation of watershed scale hydrologic and nonpoint-source pollution models. The losses of NPS N and P increase in regions of cold climate. In cold seasons, accumulations of N and P are accelerated in soil with increasing fine root and aboveground biomass mortality, decreasing plant nutrient uptake, as well as freezing soil. N and P transformation is disturbed by soil frost and snow. Moreover, factors such as physical disruption of soil aggregates, pollutant accumulation in snowpack, and snow melting can all increase the NPS N and P losses to the waterbody. Therefore, NPS N and P in first flush are more serious in cold climate. All these effects, especially frozen soil and snowpack, make great challenges to watershed scale hydrologic and nonpoint-source pollution models simulation in cold climate. Model improvements of snowmelt runoff, nutrient losses in frozen soil, as well as N and P behavior have been initiated and will be continued to evaluate in terms of their performances and suitability with different scale, hydrologic and geologic conditions in the future.},

abstract = {Agriculture and urban activities are major sources of phosphorus and nitro- gen to aquatic ecosystems. Atmospheric deposition further contributes as a source of N. These nonpoint inputs of nutrients are difficult to measure and regulate because they derive from activities dispersed over wide areas of land and are variable in time due to effects of weather. In aquatic ecosystems, these nutrients cause diverse problems such as toxic algal blooms, loss of oxygen, fish kills, loss of biodiversity (including species important for commerce and recreation), loss of aquatic plant beds and coral reefs, and other problems. Nutrient enrichment seriously degrades aquatic ecosystems and impairs the use of water for drinking, industry, agriculture, recreation, and other purposes. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain that (1) eutrophication is a widespread problem in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans, caused by over- enrichment with P and N; (2) nonpoint pollution, a major source of P and N to surface waters of the United States, results primarily from agriculture and urban activity, including industry; (3) inputs of P and N to agriculture in the form of fertilizers exceed outputs in produce in the United States and many other nations; (4) nutrient flows to aquatic ecosystems are directly related to animal stocking densities, and under high livestock densities, manure production exceeds the needs of crops to which the manure is applied; (5) excess fertilization and manure production cause a P surplus to accumulate in soil, some of which is transported to aquatic ecosystems; and (6) excess fertilization and manure production on agricultural lands create surplus N, which is mobile in many soils and often leaches to downstream aquatic ecosystems, and which can also volatilize to the atmosphere, redepositing elsewhere and eventually reaching aquatic ecosystems. If current practices continue, nonpoint pollution of surface waters is virtually certain to increase in the future. Such an outcome is not inevitable, however, because a number of technologies, land use practices, and conservation measures are capable of decreasing the flow of nonpoint P and N into surface waters. From our review of the available scientific information, we are confident that: (1) nonpoint pollution of surface waters with P and N could be reduced by reducing surplus nutrient flows in agricultural systems and processes, reducing agricultural and urban runoff by diverse methods, and reducing N emissions from fossil fuel burning; and (2) eutrophi- cation can be reversed by decreasing input rates of P and N to aquatic ecosystems, but rates of recovery are highly variable among water bodies. Often, the eutrophic state is persistent,},

abstract = {Abstract Extended severe dry and wet periods are frequently observed in the northern continental climate of the Canadian Prairies. Prairie streamflow is mainly driven by spring snowmelt of the winter snowpack, whilst summer rainfall is an important control on evapotranspiration and thus seasonality affects the hydrological response to drought and wet periods in complex ways. A field-tested physically based model was used to investigate the influences of climatic variability on hydrological processes in this region. The model was set up to resolve agricultural fields and to include key cold regions processes. It was parameterized from local and regional measurements without calibration and run for the South Tobacco Creek basin in southern Manitoba, Canada. The model was tested against snow depth and streamflow observations at multiple scales and performed well enough to explore the impacts of wet and dry periods on hydrological processes governing the basin scale hydrological response. Four hydro-climatic patterns with distinctive climatic seasonality and runoff responses were identified from differing combinations of wet/dry winter and summer seasons. Water balance analyses of these patterns identified substantive multiyear subsurface soil moisture storage depletion during drought (2001?2005) and recharge during a subsequent wet period (2009?2011). The fractional percentage of heavy rainfall days was a useful metric to explain the contrasting runoff volumes between dry and wet summers. Finally, a comparison of modeling approaches highlights the importance of antecedent fall soil moisture, ice lens formation during the snowmelt period, and peak snow water equivalent in simulating snowmelt runoff.},

Tillage comparisons were established on irrigated plots in 1992 as a randomized block design with four replications. Soil samples were collected for analyses 1 month before cotton planting of the eighth year of annual cotton (planted in March) followed by corn (planted in August). No-till resulted in significantly (p{\textless}0.01) greater soil organic C in the top 4cm of soil, where the organic C concentration was 58{\%} greater than in the top 4cm of the plow-till treatment. In the 4–8cm depth, organic C was 15{\%} greater than the plow-till control. The differences were relatively modest, but consistent with organic C gains observed in hot climates where conservation tillage has been adopted. Higher concentrations of total soil N occurred in the same treatments, however a significant (p{\textless}0.01) reduction in N was detected below 12cm in the ridge-till treatment. The relatively low amount of readily oxidizable C (ROC) in all tillage treatments suggests that much of the soil organic C gained is humic in nature which would be expected to improve C sequestration in this soil. Against the background of improved soil organic C and N, bicarbonate extractable P was greater in the top 8cm of soil. Some of the improvement, however, appeared to come from a redistribution or “mining” of P at lower soil depths. The results indicate that stratification and redistribution of nutrients were consistent with known effects of tillage modification and that slow improvements in soil fertility are being realized.},

abstract = {Abstract Spatial and temporal patterns in the onset, offset, and length of the snow season across Northern Hemisphere continents are examined for the period from 1967 to 2008. Full snow seasons (FSS) and core snow seasons (CSS) are defined based on the consistency of snow cover within a location over the course of the cold season. Climatologically, the seasonal onsets of FSS and CSS progress more rapidly across the continents than the slower spring northward offset. Average Northern Hemisphere FSS duration has decreased at a rate of 0.8 week decade−1 (5.3 days decade−1) between the winters of 1972/73 and 2007/08, while there is no significant hemispheric change in CSS duration. Changes in the FSS duration are attributed primarily to a progressively earlier offset, which has advanced poleward at a rate of 5.5 days decade−1. A major change in the trends of FSS offset and duration occurred in the late 1980s. Earlier FSS offsets, ranging from 5 to 25 days, and resultant abbreviated durations are observed in w...},

abstract = {A new version of the Integrated Nitrogen in Catchments model (INCA) was developed and tested using flow and streamwater nitrate concentration data collected from the River Kennet during 1998. INCA is a process-based model of the nitrogen cycle in the plant/soil and in-stream systems. The model simulates the nitrogen export from different land-use types within a river system, and the in-stream nitrate and ammonium concentrations at a daily time-step. The structure of the new version differs from the original, in that soil-water retention volumes have been added and the interface adapted to permit multiple crop and vegetation growth periods and fertiliser applications. The process equations are now written in terms of loads rather than concentrations allowing a more robust tracking of mass conservation when using numerical integration. The new version is able to reproduce the seasonal dynamics observed in the streamwater nitrogen concentration data, and the loads associated with plant/soil system nitrogen processes reported in the literature. As such, the model results suggest that the new structure is appropriate for the simulation of nitrogen in the River Kennet and an improvement on the original model. The utility of the INCA model is discussed in terms of improving scientific understanding and catchment management.},

abstract = {In northern alpine tundra, large slope gradients, late-lying snow drifts and shallow soils overlying impermeable substrates all contribute to large hillslope runoff volumes during the spring freshet. Understanding the processes and pathways of hillslope runoff in this environment is, therefore, critical to understanding the water cycle within northern alpine tundra ecosystems. This study: (a) presents the results of a field study on runoff from a sub-alpine tundra hillslope with a large snow drift during the spring melt period; (b) identifies the major runoff processes that must be represented in simulations of snowmelt runoff from sub-alpine tundra hillslopes: (c) describes how these processes can be represented in a numerical simulation model and d) compares field measurements with modelled output to validate or refute the conceptual understanding of runoff generation embodied in the process simulations. The study was conducted at Granger Creek catchment, 15 km south of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada, on a north-facing slope below a late-lying snow drift. For the freshet period, the major processes to be represented in a runoff model include the rate of meltwater release from the late-lying snowdrift, the elevation and thickness of the saturated layer, the magnitude of the soil permeability and its variation with depth. The daily cycle of net all-wave radiation was observed to drive the diurnal pulses of melt water from the drifts this, in turn, was found to control the daily pulses of flow through the hillslope subsurface and in the stream channel. The computed rate of frost table lowering fell within the observed values: however, there was wide variation among the measured frost table depths. Spatial variability in frost table depth would result in spatial variabilities in saturated layer depth and thickness, which would, in turn, produce variations in subsurface flow rates over the slope, including preferential flowpaths.},

Indices were calculated based on station data using a consistent approach recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices, resulting in the production of 17 temperature and 12 precipitation indices derived from daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation observations. High-quality in situ observations from over 7000 temperature and 11,000 precipitation meteorological stations across the globe were obtained to calculate the indices over the period of record available for each station. Monthly and annual indices were then interpolated onto a 3.75° × 2.5° longitude-latitude grid over the period 1901–2010. Linear trends in the gridded fields were computed and tested for statistical significance. Overall there was very good agreement with the previous HadEX dataset during the overlapping data period. Results showed widespread significant changes in temperature extremes consistent with warming, especially for those indices derived from daily minimum temperature over the whole 110 years of record but with stronger trends in more recent decades. Seasonal results showed significant warming in all seasons but more so in the colder months. Precipitation indices also showed widespread and significant trends, but the changes were much more spatially heterogeneous compared with temperature changes. However, results indicated more areas with significant increasing trends in extreme precipitation amounts, intensity, and frequency than areas with decreasing trends.},

abstract = {Recent work in seasonally snow covered ecosystems has identified thawed soil and high levels of heterotrophic activity throughout the winter under consistent snow cover. We performed measurements during the winter of 1994 to determine how the depth and timing of seasonal snow cover affect soil microbial populations, surface water NO3- loss during snowmelt, and plant N availability early in the growing season. Soi; under early accumulating,, consistent snow cover remained thawed during most of the winter and both microbial biomass and soil inorganic N pools gradually increased under the snowpack. At the initiation of snowmelt, microbial biomass N pools increased from 3.0 to 5.9 g N m(-2), concurrent with a decrease in soil inorganic N pools. During the latter stages of snowmelt, microbial biomass N pools decreased sharply without a concurrent increase in inorganic N pools or significant leaching losses. In contrast, soil under inconsistent snow cover remained frozen during most of the winter. During snowmelt, microbial biomass initially increased from 1.7 to 3.1 g N m(-2) and then decreased as sites became snow-free. In contrast to smaller pool sizes, NO3- export during snowmelt from the inconsistent snow cover sites of 1.14 (+/-0.511)g N m(-2) was significantly greater (p {\textless} 0.001) than the 0.27 (+/-0.16) g N m(-2) exported from sites with consistent snow cover. Their: data suggest that microbial biomass in consistently snow-covered soil provides a significant buffer limiting the export of inorganic N to surface water during snowmelt. However, this buffer is very sensitive to changes in snowpack regime. Therefore, interannual variability in the timing and depth of snowpack accumulation may explain the year to year variability in inorganic N concentrations in surface water these ecosystems.},

abstract = {The chemical composition of snowmelt, groundwater, and streamwater was monitored during the spring of 1991 and 1992 in a 200-ha subalpine catchment on the western flank of the Rocky Mountains near Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Most of the snowmelt occurred during a one-month period annually that began in mid-May 1991 and mid-April 1992. The average water quality characteristics of individual sampling sites (meltwater, streamwater, and groundwater) were similar in 1991 and 1992. The major ions in meltwater were differentially eluted from the snowpack, and meltwater was dominated by Ca2+, SO42−, and NO3−. Groundwater and streamwater were dominated by weathering products, including Ca2+, HCO3− (measured as alkalinity), and SiO2, and their concentrations decreased as snowmelt progressed. One well had extremely high NO3−. concentrations, which were balanced by Ca2+ concentrations. For this well, hydrogen ion was hypothesized to be generated from nitrification in overlying soils, and subsequently exchanged with other cations, particularly Ca2+. Solute concentrations in streamwater also decreased as snowmelt progressed. Variations in groundwater levels and solute concentrations indicate that most of the meltwater traveled through the surficial materials. A mass balance for 1992 indicated that the watershed retained H+, NH4+, NO3−, SO42− and Cl− and was the primary source of base cations and other weathering products. Proportionally more SO42− was deposited with the unusually high summer rainfall in 1992 compared to that released from snowmelt, whereas NO3− was higher in snowmelt and Cl− was the same. The sum of snowmelt and rainfall could account for greater than 90{\%} of the H+ and NH4+ retained by the watershed and greater than 50{\%} of the NO3−.},

A Simple Process-Based Snowmelt Routine to Model Spatially Distributed Snow Depth and Snowmelt in the SWAT Model. Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA) 1-11. DOI: 10.1111/j.1752-1688.2012.00680.x Abstract:  We present a method to integrate a process-based (PB) snowmelt model that requires only daily temperature and elevation information into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The model predicts the spatiotemporal snowpack distribution without adding additional complexity, and in fact reduces the number of calibrated parameters. To demonstrate the utility of the PB model, we calibrate the PB and temperature-index (TI) SWAT models to optimize agreement with stream discharge on a 46-km2 watershed in northwestern Idaho, United States, for 10 individual years and use the calibrated parameters for the year with the best agreement to run the model for 15 remaining years. Stream discharge predictions by the PB and TI model were similar, although the PB model simulated snowmelt more accurately than the TI model for the remaining 15-year period. Spatial snow distributions predicted by the PB model better matched observations from LandSat imagery and a SNOTEL station. Results for this watershed show that including PB snowmelt in watershed models is feasible, and calibration of TI-based watershed models against discharge can incorrectly predict snow cover.},

abstract = {Phosphorus loss from land, due to agricultural intensification, can impair water quality. The quantity lost is a function of runoff and availability, which is affected by inputs and the ability of the soil to retain P. Losses are exacerbated if surface runoff or drainage occurs soon after P inputs (e.g. fertiliser and/or manure and dung). Strategies to mitigate P losses depend on the farming system. The first step is to maintain a farm P balance (inputs–outputs) close to zero and the agronomic optimum. The next step is to use mitigation strategies in areas that lose the most P, but occupy little of the farm or catchment's area. Focusing on these areas, termed critical source areas, is more cost-effective than farm or catchment-wide strategies. However, the worry is that mitigation strategies may not keep pace with losses due to increasing intensification. Therefore, a proactive approach is needed that identifies areas resilient to P inputs and unlikely to lose P if land use is intensified.},

Annual nitrogen exports from the land surface to the river have been estimated based on land use from the 1930s and the 1990s. Long term modelled trends indicate that there has been a large increase in nitrogen transport into the river system driven by increased fertiliser application associated with increased cereal production, increased population and increased livestock levels. The dynamic model INCA (Integrated Nitrogen in Catchments) has been applied to simulate the day-to-day transport of N from the terrestrial ecosystem to the riverine environment. This process-based model generates spatial and temporal data and reproduces the observed instream concentrations. Applying the model to current land use and 1930s land use indicates that there has been a major shift in the short term dynamics since the 1930s, with increased river and groundwater concentrations caused by both non-point source pollution from agriculture and point source discharges. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Both background chemical species and added tracers exhibited the initial pulse. About 10 days after the onset of meltwater release, solute concentrations collected in the lysimeters dropped to near the average snowpack level. Silica was elevated more than major ions in some initial lysimeter samples, which is evidence of a soil-water or overland-flow contribution. Lysimeter flow rates were equivalent to about 2 cm of melted snow per day, approximately equal to the daily melt estimated from a temperature-index model. Less than 10 per cent of the ionic-tracer mass applied to snow directly above the lysimeters was present in the meltwater. Snow pits dug in an area adjacent to the lysimeters showed that ice lenses played a significant role in solute movement through the pack, influencing both solute depletion and horizontal vs vertical flow. Snow pits also showed depletion of at least 25–35 per cent of the solute mass during release of the first 10 per cent of meltwater.},

abstract = {Much of the research on the chemistry of snow and surface waters of the western US, Europe, and Asia has been conducted in high-elevation catchments above treeline. Here we provide information on the solute content of the seasonal snowpack at the Soddie site on Niwot Ridge, Colorado, a subalpine site near treeline. We focus on the storage and release of both inorganic and organic solutes to the soils underneath the snowpack, and subsequent effects on the chemical and nutrient content of the underlying soil solution and the adjacent headwater stream. The concentration of inorganic nitrogen (N) stored in the seasonal snowpack at the Soddie site of about 11 $\mu$eq L−1 was on the upper end of values reported for the northern hemisphere when compared to most areas of the Alps, Himalayas, and Tien Shan mountain ranges, but consistent with other reports of snowpacks in the Rocky Mountains. The storage of inorganic N in the snowpack at maximum accumulation averaged about 17 meq m−2, or 170 eq ha−1 (on the order of 2 kg-N ha−1). Solutes were released from storage in the form of an ionic pulse, with a maximum concentration factor of about four. In contrast to the seasonal snowpack, the dominant form of N in the soil solution was dissolved organic N. Thus, soils underlying the seasonal snowpack appear to assimilate inorganic N released from storage in the snowpack and convert it to organic N. A two component mixing model suggests that the majority of streamflow was this year's snowmelt that had infiltrated the subsurface and undergone subsequent biological and geochemical reactions. The inorganic N in surface waters at the headwaters of Como creek were always near or below detection limits, suggesting that this area at treeline is still N-limited.},

abstract = {Background: Snow and ice melt provide sensitive indicators of climate change and serve as the primary source of stream flow in alpine basins.Aims: We synthesise the results of hydrological and hydrochemical studies during the period 1995–2014, building on a long history of earlier work focused on snow and water on Niwot Ridge and the adjacent Green Lakes Valley (GLV), which is part of the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site (NWT LTER).Methods: These studies are discussed in the context of how snow, snowmelt and runoff reflect changing local climate. We review recent results of snow, snowmelt, hydrology and hydrochemistry from the plot to the basin scale, utilising new tools such as continuous global positioning system (GPS) measurements of snow depth, along with remotely-sensed measurements of snow-covered area and melt, combined with long-term measurements of snow properties, discharge and solute and isotopic content of water.Results and Conclusions: Surface–groundwater interactions are important components of water quantity and quality in alpine basins. Some or most snowmelt infiltrates underlying soils and bedrock, transporting soil and bedrock products to surface waters. Infiltrating snowmelt, along with increased melt of stored ice, increases the hydrologic connectivity between the terrestrial and aquatic systems. Alpine basins are being impacted by increases in atmospheric nitrogen deposition, which has caused changes in soil microbial processes such as nitrification. Nitrate, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen are thus flushed from soils and talus to streams. Our long-term results show that alpine catchments, such as Green Lake 4 at NWT LTER+, have the greatest sensitivity and least resilience to climate warming, with any warming leading to increased water yields.},

abstract = {A series of laboratory experiments was carried out to quantify physical and chemical factors that control the level of soluble P in soil suspensions. The objective was to identify the variables needed in models simulating the load of dissolved reactive P (DRP) in the surface runoff from cultivated land. Release of soil P as a function of water-to-soil ratio and ionic strength was investigated with soil samples collected from two experimental fields. The dynamic relationship between soil and solution P was studied by sorption-desorption isotherms. The results of the laboratory tests were compared with the mean flow-weighted concentration of DRP in the runoff water from the fields. The DRP concentration was too high to have originated solely from the eroded soil material transported in the runoff. It was concluded that DRP arose mainly by the desorption of P from the surface soil during a rain or snow-melt period. The mean DRP concentration seems to be primarily controlled by the P status of the surface soil. The DRP concentration of soil extracts obtained at wate-to-soil ratios of 250–1001 kg−1 (soil concentration range of 4–10 g l−1) corresponded to the flow-weighted mean DRP concentrations of surface runoff water and may thus be used to quantify the removal of DRP by surface runoff. The variations in the ionic strength and water-to-soil ratio in the surface soil may control the temporal variation of the DRP in the runoff water. In the present soils, a series of water extractions at different water-to-soil ratios was found to be a more reliable procedure in assessing the potential P load than the parameters derived from sorption-desorption isotherms.},

abstract = {Dissolved nitrogen (N) as urea ([NH2]2CO), nitrate (NO-3), and ammonium (NH+4) was added to naturally phosphorus (P)-rich lake water (up to 175 µg P L-1) to test the hypotheses that pollution of hypereutrophic lakes with N increases total algal abundance, alters community composition, and favors toxic cyanobacteria that do not fix atmospheric N2. Monthly experiments were conducted in triplicate in polymictic Wascana Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada, during July, August, and September 2008 using large ({\textgreater} 3140 liters) enclosures. Addition of all forms of N added at 6 mg N L-1 increased total algal abundance (as chlorophyll a) by up to 350{\%} relative to controls during August and September, when soluble reactive P (SRP) was {\textgreater} 50 µg P L-1 and dissolved N : P was {\textless} 20 : 1 by mass. In particular, NH+4 and urea favored non-heterocystous cyanobacteria and chlorophytes and NO-3, urea promoted chlorophytes, some cyanobacteria, and transient blooms of siliceous algae, whereas N2-fixing cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates exhibited little response to added N. Added N also increased microcystin production by up to 13-fold in August and September, although the magnitude of response varied with N species and predominant algal taxon (Planktothrix agardhii, Microcystis spp.). These findings demonstrate that pollution with N intensifies eutrophication and algal toxicity in lakes with elevated concentrations of SRP and low N : P, and that the magnitude of these effects depends on the chemical form, and hence source, of N.},

abstract = {This paper aims to collect and analyse existing information on different filter media used for phosphorus (P) removal from wastewater in constructed wetlands. The most commonly used materials are categorized as natural materials (considered in 39 papers), industrial byproducts (25 papers) and man-made products (10 papers). A majority of studies on sorbents have been carried out in lab-scale systems as batch experiments, and only very few studies have highlighted results on full-scale systems. Among the great variety of filter media studied, most of materials had a pH level {\textgreater}7 and high Ca (CaO) content. The highest P-removal capacities were reported for various industrial byproducts (up to 420g P kg−1 for some furnace slags), followed by natural materials (maximum 40g P kg−1 for heated opoka) and man-made filter media (maximum 12g P kg−1 for Filtralite). We found a significant positive Spearman Rank Order Correlation between the P retention and CaO and Ca content of filter materials (R2=0.51 and 0.43, respectively), whereas the relation of P retention to pH level was weak (R2=0.22) but significant. There is probably an optimal level of hydraulic loading rate at which the P removal is the highest. Additional important factors determining the applicability of filter materials in treatment wetlands such as saturation time, availability at a local level, content of heavy metals, and the recyclability of saturated filter media as fertilizer should be taken into consideration.},

All substrates, with the exception of volcanics, proved to be appropriate for microorganism and plant growth enrichment within water treatment systems. Meanwhile, phosphorus adsorption tests indicated that OS was most effective in phosphorus removal. Significant phosphorus removal was achieved in pilot tests when OS was used as a substrate in vertical-flow wetlands treating swine wastewater from an anaerobic tank. The pilot tests also indicated that both soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) removal rates increased when the HRT was prolonged. Overall, the study results showed that OS could be used for phosphorus removal in constructed wetlands, and such use carries the added benefits of reuse of a by-product that promotes sustainability.},

abstract = {The transformation of snowmelt water chemical composition during melt, elution and runoff in an Arctic tundra basin is investigated. The chemistry of the water flowing along pathways from the surface of melting snow to the 955 ha basin outlet is related to relevant hydrological processes. In so doing, this paper offers physically based explanations for the transformation of major ion concentrations and loads of runoff water associated with snowmelt and rainfall along hydrological pathways to the stream outlet. Late-lying snowdrifts were found to influence the ion chemistry in adjacent reaches of the stream channel greatly. As the initial pulse of ion-rich melt water drained from the snowdrift and was conveyed through hillslope flowpaths, the concentrations of most ions increased, and the duration of the peak ionic pulse lengthened. Over the first 3 m of overland flow, the concentrations of all ions except for NO increased by one to two orders of magnitude, with the largest increase for K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. This was roughly equivalent to the concentration increase that resulted from percolation of relatively dilute water through 025 m of unsaturated soil. The Na+ and Cl- were the dominant ions in snowmelt water, whereas Ca2+ and Mg2+ dominated the hillslope runoff. On slopes below a large melting snowdrift, ion concentrations of melt water flowing in the saturated layer of the soil were very similar to the relatively dilute concentrations found in surface runoff. However, once the snowdrift ablated, ion concentrations of subsurface flow increased above parent melt-water concentrations. Three seasonally characteristic hydrochemical regimes were identified in a stream reach adjacent to late-lying snowdrifts. In the first two stages, the water chemistry in the stream channel strongly resembled the hillslope drainage water. In the third stage, in-stream geochemical processes, including the weathering/ion exchange of Ca2+ and Mg2+, were the main control of streamwater chemistry.

However, substantial amounts of soil moisture may also move in silty clay, silty clay loam, and clay soils under dryland farming provided there is sufficient water present to support capillary flow.The dynamics of soil moisture transfer under natural conditions as a result of freezing involves movement of water in both vapor and liquid phases. In the shallow surface layer of soil, to a depth of 300–400 mm, vapor flow predominates; in the depth below, water usually moves primarily as a liquid. It is demonstrated that the accumulation of ice with time increases because of the downward movement of the freezing front and the upward movement of water into the frozen soil abov...},

abstract = {Storage heterogeneity effects on runoff generation have been well documented at the hillslope or plot scale. However, diversity across catchments can increase the range of storage conditions. Upscaling the influence of small-scale storage on streamflow across the usually more heterogeneous environment of the catchment has been difficult. The objective of this study was to observe the distribution of storage in a heterogeneous catchment and evaluate its significance and potential influence on streamflow. The study was conducted in the subarctic Canadian Shield: a region with extensive bedrock outcrops, shallow predominantly organic soils, discontinuous permafrost and numerous water bodies. Even when summer runoff was generated from bedrock hillslopes with small storage capacities, intermediary locations with large storage capacities, particularly headwater lakes, prevented water from transmitting to higher order streams. The topographic bounds of the basin thus constituted the maximum potential contributing area to streamflow and rarely the actual area. Topographic basin storage had little relation to basin streamflow, but hydrologically connected storage exhibited a strong hysteretic relationship with streamflow. This relationship defines the form of catchment function such that the basin can be defined by a series of storing and contributing curves comparable with the wetting and drying curves used in relating tension and hydraulic conductivity to water content in unsaturated soils. These curves may prove useful for catchment classification and elucidating predominant hydrological processes.

abstract = {Soil science research has probably underestimated the significance that short-term, episodic cycles of reduction and oxidation has had on phosphorus (P) reactivity. Here, the effects of eleven pulsed reduction-oxidation (including wet-dry) cycles on soil P dynamics are compared for 12 soils having contrasting properties and all overfertilised with respect to P. The laboratory based incubation conditions attempted to simulate transient waterlogging of the soil profile and involved repeated sampling and analysis of both the solution and solid phase P forms. An initial increase in P concentration in solution that occurred up to and including the fourth full cycle was followed by a sharp decline in concentration for all but one soil. Accompanying changes in the main extractable forms of P, which appeared to be cumulative, could be summarised as a general decline in the organic P fraction and an overall increase in amorphous associated inorganic forms of P. The fact that up to 60{\%} of the total soil P was demonstrated to change its sensitivity for a particular extractant suggests that these operationally defined P forms are susceptible to transformation as a consequence of changing environmental conditions. There was also a suggestion that certain of the changes in P forms were irreversible. While the laboratory conditions imposed do represent extreme conditions the soils only experienced cyclic changes in their moisture regime. If timing and frequency of intense precipitation events are likely to increase, as predicted in many climate change scenarios, then these results suggest that the effects of episodic redox pulses may have implications for P cycling in agricultural soils.},

To provide a better understanding of the magnitude of these changes and the major causes, we examine long-term increases in phytoplankton biomass and shifts in phytoplankton species dominance in the context of both in-lake and watershed processes. We compare phytoplankton and water quality data from early (1969) and recent (1994–2007) lake-wide surveys, and information from paleolimnological analysis of sediment cores and satellite remote sensing.

abstract = {Preferential flow in snowpack is an important phenomenon and influences snowpack modeling, avalanche forecasting and runoff forecasting for snow-covered basins. However, the theoretical foundation is not sufficient to develop a snowpack model that includes a water movement process including preferential flow. The water ponding process, which is caused by the water-entry value of capillary pressure, is a key process for capillary pressure overshoot, water saturation overshoot and the formation of preferential flow in other porous media like homogeneous dry sand. We attempted to apply theories of preferential flow in homogeneous dry soil to initially dry snow. Infiltration experiments into homogeneous dry snow and theoretical analysis were carried out to reveal the developing process of preferential flow during infiltration into a homogeneous dry snowpack and to obtain critical conditions for that process. The capillary pressure was measured just above the interface between the dry/wet snow layer by the tensiometer. Concurrently we conducted experiments with a dye-tracer in order to observe the flow patterns. The capillary pressure overshoot and the water-entry value were observed in experiments for samples of a large grain diameter ({\textgreater} 0.25. mm). The capillary pressure overshoot was directly linked to the formation of preferential flow. The velocity criterion and the pressure head criterion which are used to predict preferential flow for dry sand were able to predict the preferential flow for three out of our four different samples. The velocity criterion failed, however, to predict the stable case (no occurrence of preferential flow) for the experiment with the smallest grain diameter and pore size. Good agreement experimental results and both criterions were obtained from the analysis. These results showed some similarities between the developing process of preferential flow in dry sand and in dry snowpack. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Subsurface drainage is a beneficial water management practice in poorly drained soils but may also contribute substantial nitrate N loads to surface waters. This paper summarizes results from a 15-yr drainage study in Indiana that includes three drain spacings (5, 10, and 20 m) managed for 10 yr with chisel tillage in monoculture corn (Zea mays L.) and currently managed under a no-till corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation. In general, drainflow and nitrate N losses per unit area were greater for narrower drain spacings. Drainflow removed between 8 and 26{\%} of annual rainfall, depending on year and drain spacing. Nitrate N concentrations in drainflow did not vary with spacing, but concentrations have significantly decreased from the beginning to the end of the experiment. Flow-weighted mean concentrations decreased from 28 mg L(-1) in the 1986-1988 period to 8 mg L(-1) in the 1997-1999 period. The reduction in concentration was due to both a reduction in fertilizer N rates over the study period and to the addition of a winter cover crop as a "trap crop" after corn in the corn-soybean rotation. Annual nitrate N loads decreased from 38 kg ha(-1) in the 1986-1988 period to 15 kg ha(-1) in the 1997-1999 period. Most of the nitrate N losses occurred during the fallow season, when most of the drainage occurred. Results of this study underscore the necessity of long-term research on different soil types and in different climatic zones, to develop appropriate management strategies for both economic crop production and protection of environmental quality.},

abstract = {Conversion of agricultural lands to wetlands results in solubilization of residual fertilizer P, thus increasing soluble P concentration of floodwater. Previous studies have shown that application of chemical amendments such as alum, FeCl3 and CaCO3 were found to be effective in decreasing soluble P of the soil porewater. Water-table fluctuations and variable hydraulic loading rates in wetlands can alter soil redox conditions, and the solubility of P compounds. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of oxidized and reduced soil conditions on P solubility of a wetland organic soil amended with chemicals. Soil treatments evaluated include: (i) control, (ii) CaCO3 at 15.3 g kg−1, (iii) alum at 14.5 g kg−1, and (iv) FeCl3 at 1.8 g kg−1. Dissolved reactive P of soils in the control and FeCl3 amended soils responded to changes in Eh, while a less pronounced effect was noted in alum and CaCO3 amended soils. Overall, dissolved P concentrations were higher under reduced conditions and decreased with increase in Eh. The KCl-P (labile inorganic P) decreased with increase in Eh, while NaOH-RP (Fe- and Al-bound P) increased with Eh, especially in control, FeCl3 and alum amended soils. Soil amended with CaCO3 showed minimal changes in either KCl-RP or NaOH-RP. In CaCO3 amended soil, the solubility of P was regulated by the solid phases of Ca-P compounds, while in other treatments solubility was controlled by variscite, strengite, and vivianite. Amendments (such as CaCO3 and alum) that are less sensitive to changes in redox conditions may be suitable for binding P under wetland environments.},

abstract = {SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) is a comprehensive, semi-distributed river basin model that requires a large number of input parameters, which complicates model parameterization and calibration. Several calibration tech- niques have been developed for SWAT, including manual calibration procedures and automated procedures using the shuf- fled complex evolution method and other common methods. In addition, SWAT-CUP was recently developed and provides a decision-making framework that incorporates a semi-automated approach (SUFI2) using both manual and automated calibration and incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. In SWAT-CUP, users can manually adjust parameters and ranges iteratively between autocalibration runs. Parameter sensitivity analysis helps focus the calibration and uncer- tainty analysis and is used to provide statistics for goodness-of-fit. The user interaction or manual component of the SWAT-CUP calibration forces the user to obtain a better understanding of the overall hydrologic processes (e.g., baseflow ratios, ET, sediment sources and sinks, crop yields, and nutrient balances) and of parameter sensitivity. It is important for future calibration developments to spatially account for hydrologic processes; improve model run time efficiency; include the impact of uncertainty in the conceptual model, model parameters, and measured variables used in calibration; and as- sist users in checking for model errors. When calibrating a physically based model like SWAT, it is important to remember that all model input parameters must be kept within a realistic uncertainty range and that no automatic procedure can substitute for actual physical knowledge of the watershed.},

abstract = {Seasonal snowcovers release nutrients accumulated over the winter during spring snowmelt and this can be an important part of the annual biogeochemical cycling of chemicals and their loading to soils and water bodies. The characteristics of this load are controlled by snowmelt dynamics and the physical and chemical properties of the snowpack, which are affected by overwinter and snowmelt metamorphism, refreezing of meltwater, and ion exclusion from snow crystals. Rain-on-snow (ROS) events can accelerate and modify the snowpack discharge process. The interplay of these processes can cause microscale flow heterogeneity and preferential flow pathways (PFP). Previous experimental work has examined PFP and ion elution processes in snowpacks, but their combined effect on the spatial and temporal characteristics of snowmelt ion elution remains uncertain. In this research, two controlled laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the role of PFP and ROS in controlling snow ion release to runoff. These involved the high frequency monitoring of flow and meltwater concentrations during snowmelt induced by radiation-convection (RC) processes and rain-on-snow (ROS). Results without ROS show that PFP was responsible for the transport of 68–75{\%}, 73–75{\%}, and 55{\%} of the total NO3, PO4 and SO4 load discharged during the experiment. Lateral flow caused the contact zones to extend beyond the leading edges of the PFP, increasing meltwater concentrations particularly in the RC experiment where the snow microscale flow channels were better connected in early snowmelt. The results suggest that preferential elution in early melt resulting from snow ion exclusion may be more pronounced than previously thought, with the first 1.5{\%} of melt transporting more than 20{\%} of the total snowpack NO3 and PO4 load. The expected increase in the frequency of ROS events with climate change will likely reduce the magnitude of early ionic pulses in snowmelt runoff, but also make their occurrence more frequent.},

The model's abilities to simulate the long-term trend and seasonal patterns in observed stream water nitrate concentrations from 1920 to 2003 were tested. This is the first time a semi-distributed, daily time-step model has been applied to simulate such a long time period and then used to calculate detailed catchment nutrient budgets which span the conversion of pasture to arable during the late 1930s and 1940s. Thus, this work goes beyond source apportionment and looks to demonstrate how such simulations can be used to assess the state of the catchment and develop an understanding of system behaviour. The mass-balance results from 1921, 1922, 1991, 2001 and 2002 are presented and those for 1991 are compared to other modelled and literature values of loads associated with nitrogen soil processes and export. The variations highlighted the problem of comparing modelled fluxes with point measurements but proved useful for identifying the most poorly understood inputs and processes thereby providing an assessment of input data and model structural uncertainty. The modelled terrestrial and instream mass-balances also highlight the importance of the hydrological conditions in pollutant transport. Between 1922 and 2002, increased inputs of nitrogen from fertiliser, livestock and deposition have altered the nitrogen balance with a shift from possible reduction in soil fertility but little environmental impact in 1922, to a situation of nitrogen accumulation in the soil, groundwater and instream biota in 2002. In 1922 and 2002 it was estimated that approximately 2 and 18 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively were exported from the land to the stream. The utility of the approach and further considerations for the best use of models are discussed.},

abstract = {In order to demonstrate the spatial and temporal variations in meltwater chemistry at both the lysimeter (0.25 m2) and basin scale, field measurements of snowmelt were conducted in northern Canada. These observations show that microscale variations in flow volume are accompanied by variations in meltwater chemistry. For example, the solute concentrations were largest in areas with low flow, while the largest mass flux occurred in the areas with highest flow. The observed variations in both concentration and mass flux can be quantitatively described by the relationships described by Hibberd [1984). The field measurements clearly demonstrate that in order to estimate the average meltwater chemistry, it is necessary to sample the flow field at a scale similar to that required to average the lateral variations in meltwater volume. Variations in meltwater runoff chemistry also occur at the basin scale due to changes in snowcover depth and the resulting differences in the timing of meltwater release. For example, at this site, meltwater release occurs up to a week earlier from the shallow snow covers than for the deeper snow covers. It would be expected that this asynchronous meltwater runoff would result in a smoothing of the ionic pulse at the basin scale, with lower peak values and a more gradual decline in concentration when compared with meltwater at a point.},

This review, from the perspective of ecology and environmental science, illustrates the important role of a physically based distributed model as a solution to issues related to ecohydrological processes, offering a major discussion of issues that received little attention from the previous reviewers and that would interest researchers without a hydrology background. The inevitable and possible difficulties confronting these potential users at the beginning and early stages of utilizing the model are also brought to light, with suggestions for solutions. This paper offers a brief review of MIKE SHE development and elaborates its main merits, key problems, and research on the model's theories and practices implemented by scholars. Lingering problems in current solutions are analyzed, and potential approaches to solutions are proposed. We hope that this paper provides some practical advice to researchers who want to initiate study of water issues related to modeling ecohydrological processes by employing MIKE SHE.},

abstract = {Non-point source pollution due to agricultural activities is an important problem that has been threatening water resources in Canadian prairie watersheds. The development of strategies to prevent nutrient loss depends on the quantification of nutrient mobilization and transport across a watershed. Integrated eco-hydrological models can play an important role in this regard. However, current model applicability to cold-climate Canadian prairie watersheds is limited due to the complex dynamics of nutrient export under the existence of numerous landscape depressions and freeze-thaw cycles. The aim of this study was to evaluate an eco-hydrological model for nutrient export prediction and assess the impacts of management practices for a cold-climate prairie watershed. To achieve the objectives, a new version of the SWAT model called SWAT-PDLD, which combines SWAT and a Probability Distributed Landscape Depressions (PDLD) model, along with a seasonally varying soil erodibility factor, was applied to a Canadian prairie watershed (the Assiniboine River watershed, Saskatchewan, Canada). The PDLD module is used to simulate the effect of the numerous landscape depressions that exist in these watersheds on streamflow, whereas a seasonally varying soil erodibility factor is used to take into account seasonal variation of sediment and nutrient generation due to the cold climate conditions. Model calibration and uncertainty analysis were performed using the Sequential Uncertainty FItting (SUFI-2). The study shows that the SWAT-PDLD model with seasonally varying soil erodibility simulates the daily nutrient export in a cold prairie watershed satisfactorily as confirmed by both graphical plots and statistical measures. A sensitivity analysis of sub-watershed discretization revealed that the streamflow is relatively insensitive to sub-watershed discretization but it did affect sediment and nutrient export. Importantly, the model shows that both filter strips and cover crops decreased sediment, phosphorous, and nitrogen export, while conservation tillage increased phosphorous export in the study watershed.},

abstract = {SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) is a comprehensive, semi-distributed river basin model that requires a large number of input parameters, which complicates model parameterization and calibration. Several calibration tech- niques have been developed for SWAT, including manual calibration procedures and automated procedures using the shuf- fled complex evolution method and other common methods. In addition, SWAT-CUP was recently developed and provides a decision-making framework that incorporates a semi-automated approach (SUFI2) using both manual and automated calibration and incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. In SWAT-CUP, users can manually adjust parameters and ranges iteratively between autocalibration runs. Parameter sensitivity analysis helps focus the calibration and uncer- tainty analysis and is used to provide statistics for goodness-of-fit. The user interaction or manual component of the SWAT-CUP calibration forces the user to obtain a better understanding of the overall hydrologic processes (e.g., baseflow ratios, ET, sediment sources and sinks, crop yields, and nutrient balances) and of parameter sensitivity. It is important for future calibration developments to spatially account for hydrologic processes; improve model run time efficiency; include the impact of uncertainty in the conceptual model, model parameters, and measured variables used in calibration; and as- sist users in checking for model errors. When calibrating a physically based model like SWAT, it is important to remember that all model input parameters must be kept within a realistic uncertainty range and that no automatic procedure can substitute for actual physical knowledge of the watershed.},

abstract = {In a naturally stratified snow cover the movement of meltwater into dry snow is complicated by the interaction of the wetting front with stratigraphic horizons. Field observations showed that when the wetting front reached premelt stratigraphic horizons, water ponded at the interface and then flow fingers developed and penetrated the lower stratum. The flux in these fingers, which was increased to about twice that of the surface flux, was used to feed water to the impeding horizons where it froze to form ice layers. These ice layers were the major source of latent heat released within the snow cover, and they were responsible for the warming of the snow and the underlying soil. These continuous ice layers grew only at stratigraphic boundaries. Because of this ice layer growth the wetting front advance was retarded, and the arrival of meltwater at the snow cover base was significantly delayed. Owing to a cold substrate the strong heat flux from the snow into the soil delays the warming of the snow cover and limits runoff after the snow is isothermal at 0°C by the refreezing of soil infiltration and the development of a basal ice layer.},

abstract = {Export of agricultural nutrients and sediment to lakes and oceans is of great environmental concern in many agricultural watersheds. Recent years have seen efforts to reduce loads through agricultural practices such as conservation tillage, efficient fertilization, and reservation of erodible areas. Monitoring the efficacy of such efforts is complicated by the fact they take place against a varying climatic and hydrologic background. In this study, statistical analysis was used to identify those climatic, hydrologic, and agricultural variables that best explained variations in nitrate, phosphorus, and total suspended solids over the period 1976-1995 in two large agricultural watersheds that feed Lake Erie, those of the Maumee and Sandusky Rivers. The dominant variable was stream discharge; after curvefits to remove its influence, the residual loads were tested via stepwise linear regression to reveal the most significant explanatory variables. Loads of nitrate, total suspended solids, and total phosphorus tended to decrease when previous months were wet, except in the summer, and to decrease when snow cover was extensive. It is speculated that stores of nitrate in the soil were lost during wet periods through increased crop uptake and/or leaching. Nitrogen fertilizer application in the Maumee watershed decreased following dry periods, but not enough to decrease stream loads. Soluble reactive phosphorus loads were negatively correlated to conservation tillage and reserves, and positively correlated to fertilizer and manure sources. Results for total phosphorus were similar to those for total suspended solids, on which most transported phosphorus is adsorbed.},

@article{Nachshon2013,
abstract = {The semiarid glaciated plains of the North American continent, known as the prairies, are characterized by an undulating terrain rich in sulfate salts in the subsurface, with ephemeral streams and large numbers of wetlands containing seasonal or semi-permanent ponds. Salinization is a potential concern for the diverse community of vegetation, aquatic ecosystems, wildlife and agricultural production supported by the prairies, especially as a result of land use changes and climate change. In this paper, a literature review of prairie salt dynamics and distribution is presented. On the basis of observations from past field studies, a conceptual model describing prairie sulfate salt dynamics is proposed, which identifies a number of important zones of salt accumulation in the subsurface and in surface water. As is the case in any other environment, the distribution of salts is determined by the hydrological conditions, in particular subsurface flow pathways and evapotranspiration front locations. However, the semi-arid climate and glacial geology of the region result in unique and characteristic hydrological conditions and distributions of accumulated salts. The hydrology of the prairies is sensitive to land use, with the major changes over the past 100years or so being conversion of prairie grasslands to annual dryland crops and drainage of wetlands. Moreover, in semi-arid environments the hydrological system is highly sensitive to climate variability and change. Hence, even small hydrological changes may result in mobilization of salts concentrated in the shallow subsurface, and, if sustained, may generate ground surface, wetland and surface water salinization. However, these changes are difficult to predict, involving multiple interacting processes, and it is therefore necessary to develop an improved, quantitative understanding of the coupled hydrological and geochemical processes in order to manage or adapt to future changes.},

abstract = {Spatial statistics of snow water equivalent (SWE) and melt rate were measured using spatially distributed, sequential ground surveys of depth and density in forested, shrub and alpine tundra environments over several seasons within a 185 km(2) mountain catchment in Yukon Territory, Canada. When stratified by slope/aspect sub-units within landscape classes, SWE frequency distributions matched the log-normal, but multiclass surveys showed a more bimodal distribution. Within-class variability of winter SWE could be grouped into (i) windswept tundra and (ii) sheltered tundra/forest regimes. During melt, there was little association between the standard deviation and mean of SWE. At small scales, a negative correlation developed between spatial distributions of pre-melt SWE and melt rate where shrubs were exposed above the snow. This was not evident in dense-forest, alpine-tundra or deep-snowdrift landscape classes. At medium scales, adja-negative SWE and melt-rate correlations were also found between mean values from adjacent slope sub-units of the tundra landscape class. The medium-scale correlation was likely due to slope effects on insolation and blowing-snow redistribution. At the catchment scale, the correlation between mean SWE and melt rate from various landscape classes reversed to a positive one, likely influenced by intercepted and blowing regimes, shrub exposure during melt and adiabatic cooling with elevation rise. Covariance at the catchment scale resulted in a 40{\%} acceleration of snow depletion. These results suggest that the spatial variability and covariability of both SWE and melt rate are scale- and landscape-class-specific and need to be considered in a landscape-stratified manner at the appropriate scale when snow depletion is described and the snowmelt duration predicted.},

In April 1997 and 1998, intensive snow surveys were conducted in the 6.9-km super(2) Loch Vale watershed (LVWS), Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Binary decision trees were used to model the large-scale variations in snow depth, while the small-scale variations were modeled through kriging interpolation methods. Binary decision trees related depth to the physically based independent variables of net solar radiation, elevation, slope, and vegetation cover type. These decision tree models explained 54-65{\%} of the observed variance in the depth measurements. The tree-based modeled depths were then subtracted from the measured depths, and the resulting residuals were spatially distributed across LVWS through kriging techniques. The kriged estimates of the residuals were added to the tree-based modeled depths to produce a combined depth model. The combined depth estimates explained 60-85{\%} of the variance in the measured depths. Snow densities were mapped across LVWS using regression analysis. Snow-covered area was determined from high-resolution aerial photographs. Combining the modeled depths and densities with a snow cover map produced estimates of the spatial distribution of snow water equivalence (SWE). This modeling approach offers improvement over previous methods of estimating SWE distribution in mountain basins.},

abstract = {This chapter emphasizes on the effects that lime and phosphate applications have on the soil–plant system. An understanding of such effects is essential for those involved in the development and management of acid, phosphate-fixing soils. The response of crop plants to liming has been reviewed extensively by Pearson. In acid soils with a pH less than 5.0–5.5, initial lime applications result in large increases in crop growth and yield. The positive growth response is because of amelioration of aluminium (Al) toxicity because the soluble and exchangeable soil Al precipitates as hydroxy-Al species as the pH is raised. An understanding of the chemistry of soil A1 is central to the understanding of the fertility of acid soils. Because phytotoxic concentrations of soluble and exchangeable A1 often limits crop production on acid soils, there is increasing interest in basing lime requirements on estimates of exchangeable or reactive pools of soil A1 rather than on the amount required to bring the soil to an arbitrarily defined pH such as 6.5. Phosphate deficiency is common on highly weathered acid soils that often possess a high phosphate fixation capacity. In soils high in organic matter, liming may result in an initial burst of microbial activity and the mineralization of soil organic phosphorus.},

abstract = {Intensification of agriculture has led to renewed efforts to drain wetlands throughout North American prairies. It is perceived to threaten downstream ecosystem health through enhancing nutrient, bacteria and salt loading. An experiment was conducted to determine temporal variations in wetland solute storage and export upon drainage. Water quality along seven ditches and five natural spills that form between wetlands was also compared. The experimental wetland acted as a solute storage zone prior to its drainage. Variations in salts and DOC were influenced by hydrological processes, whereas variations in nutrients and bacteria were also influenced by biotic and/or sorption processes. Wetland water quality was an important control of drainage water quality as the wetland ditch acted as a simple conduit. Concentrations of TDN, DOC, HCO3−, K+, and Ca2+ were higher in ditches than spills. Minimal changes in water quality along ditches and spills occurred, likely due to low spring temperatures that can restrict biotic processing and sorption. Since ditches connect wetlands to streams, they have a greater potential to contribute to downstream solute loading than spills. Wetland drainage efficiency and wetland water quality were deemed the factors critical to determining solute exports via ditches.},

abstract = {Overwinter and snowmelt processes are thought to be critical to controllers of nitrogen (N) cycling and retention in northern forests. However, there have been few measurements of basic N cycle processes (e.g. mineralization, nitrification, denitrification) during winter and little analysis of the influence of winter climate on growing season N dynamics. In this study, we manipulated snow cover to assess the effects of soil freezing on in situ rates of N mineralization, nitrification and soil respiration, denitrification (intact core, C2H2 - based method), microbial biomass C and N content and potential net N mineralization and nitrification in two sugar maple and two yellow birch stands with reference and snow manipulation treatment plots over a two year period at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, U.S.A. The snow manipulation treatment, which simulated the late development of snowpack as may occur in a warmer climate, induced mild (temperatures {\textgreater} -5 °C) soil freezing that lasted until snowmelt. The treatment caused significant increases in soil nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in sugar maple stands, but did not affect mineralization, nitrification, denitrification or microbial biomass, and had no significant effects in yellow birch stands. Annual N mineralization and nitrification rates varied significantly from year to year. Net mineralization increased from ∼ 12.0 g N m-2 y-1 in 1998 to ∼ 22 g N m-2 y-1 in 1999 and nitrification increased from ∼ 8 g N m-2 y-1 in 1998 to ∼ 13 g N m-2 y-1 in 1999. Denitrification rates ranged from 0 to 0.65 g N m-2 y-1. Our results suggest that mild soil freezing must increase soil NO3- levels by physical disruption of the soil ecosystem and not by direct stimulation of mineralization and nitrification. Physical disruption can increase fine root mortality, reduce plant N uptake and reduce competition for inorganic N, allowing soil NO3- levels to increase even with no increase in net mineralization or nitrification.},

abstract = {Controls of stream water NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} in mountainous and forested catchments are not thoroughly understood. Long-term trends in stream water NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} are positive, neutral and negative, often apparently independent of trends in N deposition. Here, time series of NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} in four small acid-sensitive catchments in southern Norway were analysed in order to identify likely drivers of long-term changes in NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. In two sites, stream water NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} export declined ca 50{\%} over a period of 25 years while in the other sites NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} export increased with roughly 20{\%}. Discharge and N deposition alone were poor predictors of these trends. The most distinct trends in NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} were found in winter and spring. Empirical models explained between 45{\%} and 61{\%} of the variation in weekly concentrations of NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, and described both upward and downward seasonal trends tolerably well. Key explaining variables were snow depth, discharge, temperature and N deposition. All catchments showed reductions in snow depth and increases in winter discharge. In two inland catchments, located in moderate N deposition areas, these climatic changes appeared to drive the distinct decreases in winter and spring concentrations and fluxes of NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. In a coast-near mountainous catchment in a low N deposition area, these climatic changes appeared to have the opposite effect, i.e. lead to increases in especially winter NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. This suggests that the effect of a reduced snow pack may result in both decreased and increased catchment N leaching depending on interactions with N deposition, soil temperature regime and winter discharge.},

abstract = {The spatial heterogeneity of mountain snow cover and ablation is important in controlling patterns of snow cover depletion (SCD), meltwater production, and runoff, yet is not well-represented in most large-scale hydrological models and land surface schemes. Analyses were conducted in this study to examine the influence of various representations of snow cover and melt energy heterogeneity on both simulated SCD and stream discharge from a small alpine basin in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Simulations were performed using the Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM), where point-scale snowmelt computations were made using a snowpack energy balance formulation and applied to spatial frequency distributions of snow water equivalent (SWE) on individual slope-, aspect-, and landcover-based hydrological response units (HRUs) in the basin. Hydrological routines were added to represent the vertical and lateral transfers of water through the basin and channel system. From previous studies it is understood that the heterogeneity of late winter SWE is a primary control on patterns of SCD. The analyses here showed that spatial variation in applied melt energy, mainly due to differences in net radiation, has an important influence on SCD at multiple scales and basin discharge, and cannot be neglected without serious error in the prediction of these variables. A single basin SWE distribution using the basin-wide mean SWE (SWE‾) and coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation/mean) was found to represent the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of SWE sufficiently well. Simulations that accounted for differences in (SWE‾) among HRUs but neglected the sub-HRU heterogeneity of SWE were found to yield similar discharge results as simulations that included this heterogeneity, while SCD was poorly represented, even at the basin level. Finally, applying point-scale snowmelt computations based on a single SWE depth for each HRU (thereby neglecting spatial differences in internal snowpack energetics over the distributions) was found to yield similar SCD and discharge results as simulations that resolved internal energy differences. Spatial/internal snowpack melt energy effects are more pronounced at times earlier in spring before the main period of snowmelt and SCD, as shown in previously published work. The paper discusses the importance of these findings as they apply to the warranted complexity of snowmelt process simulation in cold mountain environments, and shows how the end-of-winter SWE distribution represents an effective means of resolving snow cover heterogeneity at multiple scales for modelling, even in steep and complex terrain.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We explored catchment processes that control stream nutrient concentrations at an upland forest in northeastern Vermont, USA, where inputs of nitrogen via atmospheric deposition are among the highest in the nation and affect ecosystem functioning. We traced sources of water, nitrate, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) using stream water samples collected at high frequency during spring snowmelt. Hydrochemistry, isotopic tracers, and end-member mixing analyses suggested the timing, sources, and source areas from which water and nutrients entered the stream. Although stream-dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) both originated from leaching of soluble organic matter, flushing responses between these two DOM components varied because of dynamic shifts of hydrological flow paths and sources that supply the highest concentrations of DOC and DON. High concentrations of stream water nitrate originated from atmospheric sources as well as nitrified sources from catchment soils. We detected nitrification in surficial soils during late snowmelt which affected the nitrate supply that was available to be transported to streams. However, isotopic tracers showed that the majority of nitrate in upslope surficial soil waters after the onset of snowmelt originated from atmospheric sources. A fraction of the atmospheric nitrogen was directly delivered to the stream, and this finding highlights the importance of quick flow pathways during snowmelt events. These findings indicate that interactions among sources, transformations, and hydrologic transport processes must be deciphered to understand why concentrations vary over time and over space as well as to elucidate the direct effects of human activities on nutrient dynamics in upland forest streams.},

abstract = {Although it has been suggested that atmospheric deposition alone can result in detectable levels of pesticides in wetlands of the Pairie Pothole Region of Canada, this is the first field study to compare the masses of pesticides entering wetlands by atmospheric deposition with those concentrations of pesticides detected in the water-column of prairie wetlands. Weekly air and bulk deposition samples were collected from May 26th to Sept. 15th, 2008 at the Manitoba Zero Tillage Research Association (MZTRA) Farm, Brandon, Manitoba, with four on-site wetlands (approximate sizes 0.15–0.45 ha) monitored every second week. Twelve pesticides were detected in the air, with MCPA (one of the three pesticides applied on the farm in 2008 in addition to clopyralid and glyphosate), triallate, and $\gamma$-HCH being detected every week. Calculations were performed to predict wetland pesticide concentrations based on bulk deposits alone for those pesticides that had detectable concentrations in the bulk deposition samples (in order of the highest total seasonal deposition mass to the lowest): MCPA, glyphosate, 2,4-D, clopyralid, bromoxynil, atrazine, dicamba, metolachlor, and mecoprop. The estimated concentrations were closest to actual concentrations for MCPA (Pearson correlation coefficient's = 0.91 to 0.98; p-values {\textless} 0.001) and predictions were also reasonable for a range of other herbicides, but a source other than atmospheric deposition was clearly relevant to detections of clopyralid in the wetland water-column. Although the types and levels of pesticides detected in the wetlands of the current study suggest that regional pesticide applications can contribute to pesticide surface water contamination following atmospheric transport and deposition, the greater frequency and concentrations of clopyralid, MCPA, and glyphosate detections in wetlands confirm that on-farm pesticide applications have a greater impact on on-site water quality. Beneficial management practices that reduce application drift, as well as rainfall or snowmelt runoff, will be important measures in reducing pesticide loading into wetlands situated in agricultural fields of the Prairie Pothole Region of North America.},

abstract = {Transport of solutes and colloids in soils, particularly those subject to preferential flow along macropores, is important for assessing the vulnerability of shallow groundwater to contamination. The objective of this study was to investigate flow and transport phenomena for dissolved and colloid tracers during large infiltration events in partially saturated, macroporous soils. Controlled tracer infiltration tests were completed at two field sites in southern Ontario. A tension infiltrometer (TI) was used to infiltrate water with dissolved Brilliant Blue FCF dye simultaneously with 3.7 µm and 0.53 µm diameter fluorescent microspheres. Infiltration was conducted under maximum infiltration pressure heads ranging from −5.2 to −0.4 cm. All infiltration test sites were excavated to examine and photograph dye-stained flow patterns, map soil features, and collect samples for microsphere enumeration. Results indicated that preferential transport of dye and microspheres via macropores occurred when maximum pressure heads were greater than −3.0 cm, and the corresponding infiltration rates exceeded 2.0 cm h−1. Dye and microspheres were detected at depths greater than 70 cm under the highest infiltration rates from both sites. Microsphere concentrations in the top 5–10 cm of soil decreased by more than two orders of magnitude relative to input concentrations, yet remained relatively constant with depth thereafter. There was some evidence for increased retention of the 3.7 µm microspheres relative to the 0.53 µm microspheres, particularly at lower infiltration pressures where straining and attachment mechanisms are most prevalent. Microspheres were observed within dye stained soil matrix surrounding individual macropores, illustrating the significance of capillary pressures in controlling the vertical migration of both tracers in the vicinity of the macropores. Overall, microsphere distributions closely followed the dye patterns, with microsphere concentrations at all depths directly related to the intensity (or concentration) of dye staining. It is concluded that the flow system influenced transport to a much greater degree than differences between dissolved and colloidal species, and hence a dye tracer could serve as a reasonable surrogate for colloid distributions in the vadose zone following individual infiltration events.},

Previous research has shown that VBS can be effective at trapping phosphorus (P) and other farm-sourced environmental contaminants. This project measured the effectiveness of established vegetated strips at decreasing P in runoff from agricultural fields in Manitoba. Paired samples of runoff, taken at the field edge and in the vegetated strip, indicated that in 11 of the 22 cases sampled (50{\%}), P concentrations in the runoff decreased (on average 30{\%}) as the flow passed through the vegetated strip. In 7 of the 22 case (32{\%}) there was no difference; however, in four of the 22 cases (18{\%}), runoff P concentrations increased, indicating the vegetated strip had become a source of runoff P.

The first objective is to review and introduce the research addressed within this special collection. The second objective is to summarize and synthesize the model performance statistics and parameters published in these articles to provide a succinct guide to complement a previous SWAT model summary. Recent SWAT developments in landscape representation, stream routing, and soil P dynamics are presented in this collection. Numerous critical applications of the SWAT model were conducted across a variety of landscape scales, climatic and physiographic regions, and pollutant sources. In this article, model performance in terms of coefficient of determination, Nash‐Sutcliffe efficiency, and percent bias across all the studies is summarized and found to be satisfactory or better in all cases. These results are then compiled with a previous synthesis of results to generate a comprehensive assessment of SWAT. Model parameters used to calibrate the model for streamflow, sediment, N, and P in numerous studies are also summarized. This collection demonstrates that research in development and application of the SWAT model and associated tools continues to grow internationally in a wide range of settings and applications.},

We previously determined that non-limiting N conditions for near maximum corn (Zea mays L.) grain yield are reached with the following threshold values for three in-season plant-based indicators of corn N nutrition determined at approximately the V12 stage of development: N nutrition index (NNI) = 0.88, leaf N (NL) concentration = 32.7 mg N g−1 leaf DM, and relative chlorophyll meter (RCM) values = 0.95.

Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and adjacent large lakes support a significant portion of the continent's breeding population, and have high economic value for recreational and commercial fisheries; no recent assessment of cormorant diet has been conducted in this region. We measured stable isotopes ($\delta$13C, $\delta$15N, and $\delta$34S) in cormorant muscle and used a Bayesian mixing model approach to estimate cormorant diet composition throughout the Lake Winnipeg system, including the contribution of commercially and recreationally harvested walleye (Sander vitreus) and sauger (Sander canadensis). We estimated that cormorants occupied a trophic position around 4.0, which corresponds to a generalist diet, and consumed a small proportion of walleye (range of mean estimates: 6-12{\%}) and sauger (range of mean estimates: 7-12{\%}). We also examined the concentrations of 15 trace elements in cormorant muscle to evaluate the potential role that these birds played in contaminant flow and how these elements behaved trophically. Cd, Fe, Mn, Hg, and Se showed evidence of biomagnification in Lake Winnipeg's north basin, but only Hg biomagnified in the south basin; nutrient source (benthic vs. pelagic) had little effect on elemental concentrations. Our results add to the growing evidence that the two main basins of Lake Winnipeg are biologically distinct from each other, and that cormorants likely have little effect on the populations of harvested fishes. {\textcopyright} 2015 International Association for Great Lakes Research..},

abstract = {Conservation tillage practices have become increasingly common in recent years to reduce soil erosion, improve water conservation, and increase soil organic matter. Research suggests that conservation tillage can stratify soil test phosphorus (P), but little is known about the effects on soil organic P. This study was conducted to assess the long-term effects of tillage practices (no-till [NT] and mouldboard plowing) and P fertilization (0 and 35 kg P ha−1) on the distribution of P species in the soil profile. Soil samples from a long-term corn–soybean rotation experiment in Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada, were collected from three depths (0–5, 5–10, and 10–20 cm). These samples were analyzed for total P (TP), total C (TC), total N (TN), pH, and Mehlich-3 P (PM3); P forms were characterized with solution phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-NMR). Results showed a stratification of TP, TC, TN, pH, PM3, and Mehlich-3–extractable aluminum and magnesium under NT management. The PM3 and orthophosphate concentrations were greater at the soil surface (0–5 cm) of the NT-P35 (soil treatment with 35 kg P ha−1) treatment. Organic P forms (orthophosphate monoesters, especially scyllo-IP6, and nucleotides) had accumulated in the deep layer of NT treatment possibly due to preferential movement. We found evidence that the NT system and P fertilization changed the distribution of P forms along the soil profile, potentially increasing soluble inorganic P loss in surface runoff and organic P in drainage and decreasing bioavailability of inorganic and organic P in deeper soil layers.},

abstract = {In Switzerland, floods, debris flows, landslides and rockfalls cause damage every year affecting property values, infrastructure, forestry and agriculture. As population and settled areas have increased, the damage potential has also become greater. Information about natural hazard events that caused any damage is needed for hazard mapping and further decision making. This is why the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL has been systematically collecting information on flood and mass movement damage in a database since 1972. The estimated direct financial damage as well as fatalities and injured people have been documented using press articles as the main source of information. The database can provide answers to questions related to the temporal and spatial distribution of damage, natural hazard processes and the corresponding weather conditions. This study describes the data collection methods used and the key analyses of data from 1972 to 2007. Furthermore, the benefits and drawbacks of the database are discussed. In Switzerland, naturally triggered floods, debris flows, landslides and rockfalls have caused financial damage amounting to nearly 8000 million Euros in total within the last 36 years (taking inflation into account). These processes have mainly affected pre-and central alpine regions and their total costs of damage are dominated by a few major events. Nearly one quarter of the costs result from August 2005 when large parts of Northern Switzerland were affected by flooding. We must assume that major events like this are not unique and that similar events will occur again in future.},

The available datasets for model development, particularly the phosphorus input and water quality calibration data, in this case study are unique because of the large amount of watershed specific, spatially and temporally varying data that are available for model development. Relative to the default SWAT inputs, alternative model input generation methodologies were tested and shown to produce more representative inputs that generate substantially different simulation results. The successful application of SWAT2000 in this case study required two critical model modifications regarding excess soil water movement in frozen soils and soil erosion predictions under snow cover. The Nash–Suttcliffe coefficient of efficiency (ENS) for daily flows at the main flow station in the watershed was at least 0.80 in both the seven-year calibration period and the one year and four year validation periods. Average monthly total phosphorus loads were predicted within 15{\%} of the corresponding measured data and the monthly ENS coefficients for total phosphorus were at least 0.63 in the calibration and validation periods. The results of this study are important for future SWAT modelling studies in gauged and ungauged watersheds, especially those in regions like the Northeast US that are subject to freezing temperatures in winter.},

abstract = {Meltwater released by shallow snow covers of the Canadain Prairies is an important water resource to the region.  Therefore, many water-management agencies are interested in methods of forecasting streamflow and seasonal water yield from snowmelt. Reliable, accurae forecasts, however, require information of the time of melt and snowmelt rates and volumes. At the present time these quantities are usually estimated by simple temperature-index methods, which have not proven successful in open grassland environments.  The paper describes the development and testing of a snowmelt model that uses the energy equation as its physical framework.  Empirical procedures for evaluating radiative, convective, and internal-energy terms from standard climatological measurements are presented.  Algorithms for accounting for changes in the energy terms in a daily energy-balance model are described.  The application of the energy-budget snowmelt model (EBSM) for predicting ablation and simulating streamflow from small and large watersheds is evaluated.  It is demonstrated that the EBSM is workable in an operational forecast system and when incorporated within such a system leads to general improvement in synthesising streamflow from snowmelt.},

Here, we provide the first full model description since 2002 and then test the latest version of the model (v1.4.4) in a small rural catchment in northeast Scotland. The particulate phosphorus simulation was much improved compared to previous model versions, whilst the latest sorption equations allowed us to explore the potential time lags between reductions in terrestrial inputs and improvements in surface water quality, an issue of key policy relevance. The model is particularly suitable for use as a research tool, but should only be used to inform policy and land management in data-rich areas, where parameters and processes can be well-constrained.

abstract = {Water resource management is often based on numerical models, and large-scale models are sometimes used for international strategic agreements. Sometimes the modelled area entails several political entities and river basins. To avoid methodological bias in results, methods and databases should be homogenous across political and geophysical boundaries, but this may involve fewer details and more assumptions. This paper quantifies the uncertainty when the same model code is applied using two different input datasets; a more detailed one for the country of Sweden (S-HYPE) and a more general one for the entire Baltic Sea basin (Balt-HYPE). Results from the two model applications were compared for the Swedish landmass and for two specific Swedish river basins. The results show that both model applications may be useful in providing spatial information of water and nutrients at various scales. For water discharge, most relative errors are {\textless}10{\%} for S-HYPE and {\textless}25{\%} for Balt-HYPE. Both applications reproduced the most mean concentration for nitrogen within 25{\%} of the observed mean values, but phosphorus showed a larger scatter. Differences in model set-up were reflected in the simulation of both spatial and temporal dynamics. The most sensitive data were precipitation/temperature, agriculture and model parameter values.},

@article{Hodson2006,
abstract = {Solute mass balance, hydrochemical data, and hydrological process data are used to present the first detailed account of catchment biogeochemistry in an Antarctic melt season. The study was undertaken in a small glacial catchment in the maritime Antarctic (Signy Island, South Orkney Islands), where extreme ecosystem changes have been observed at the ice margin. Here melting caused a snowpack solute elution phase characterized by the production of extremely concentrated solutions just centimeters from the snow surface. These were equivalent to 2{\%} marine water and dominated by sea-salt aerosol. Nutrients were also present but were rapidly sequestered in snowpack and ice marginal environments. Thus the decoupling of nutrient dynamics from other snowpack solutes seems to occur almost immediately after melt and testifies to the presence of a glacial ecosystem. Although significant, the estimated rates of nutrient uptake were low (0.025 gNH4-N/m2/yr and 0.0011 gPO4-P/m2/yr, equivalent to 66 and 74{\%} of total annual atmospheric inputs) and, in the case of NH4+, 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than those reported for temperate snowpacks. However, the data also demonstrated significant NO3− production (0.030 gNO3-N/m2/yr or 3 times total atmospheric inputs) that appears to be associated with zones of high rock-water contact at the ice margin. After the early snowpack elution phase, nutrient cycling was also greatly influenced by inputs from penguin and seal excreta. Thus local marine ecosystems enhance the nutrient content of meltwaters and fertilize the glacial, terrestrial, and aquatic ecosystems that are responding to climate change in the maritime Antarctic.},

abstract = {Cover crops, although they may reduce the leaching of NO3-N to groundwater, may increase nutrient concentration in runoff because of biomass leaching during rainfall events. A simulated rainfall study was conducted in the laboratory to determine the effects of freezing alone and freezing plus drying treatments, loading rate, and rainfall intensity on the leaching of NH4-N, NO3-N, and inorganic P from the biomass of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.), and oilseed radish [Raphanus sativus (L.) var. oleifera Dc Metzg]. Concentration of P increased during early stages of leaching, then decreased slowly but remained greater than 50{\%} of the maximum, even after the equivalent of 6.0 cm of simulated rainfall. Concentrations of NO3-N were similar to P but changed less during leaching. Weighted mean concentrations of P ranged from less than 2.0 to more than 15 mg L-1. Concentrations were greatest with oilseed radish and least with red clover. Drying the sample in addition to freezing increased the P concentration, particularly in the initial leaching. About 30{\%} of the biomass P was leached from oilseed radish and annual ryegrass, but only about 20{\%} from red clover. Because oilseed radish had a greater biomass P concentration, the total P leached was much greater than for the other two species. Between 5 and 9{\%} of the biomass N was leached as either NO3-N or NH4-N from ryegrass and red clover while over 10{\%} was leached from oilseed radish. The results indicate that cover crop species differed markedly in their potential impact on nutrient concentration, particularly P, in runoff. Of the three cover crops tested, oilseed radish has the greatest potential impact and red clover the least.},

abstract = {Watershed models have been widely used for creating the scientific basis for management decisions regarding nonpoint source pollution. In this study, we evaluated the current state of watershed scale, spatially distributed, process-based, water quality modeling of nutrient pollution. Beginning from 1992, the year when Beven and Binley published their seminal paper on uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling, and ending in 2010, we selected 257 scientific publications which (i) employed spatially distributed modeling approaches at a watershed scale; (ii) provided predictions of flow, nutrient/sediment concentrations or loads; and (iii) reported fit to measured data. Most "best practices" (optimization, validation, sensitivity, and uncertainty analysis) are not consistently employed during model development. There are no statistically significant differences in model performance among land uses. Studies which used more than one point in space to evaluate their distributed models had significantly lower median values of the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (0.70 vs 0.56, p {\textless} 0.005, nonparametric Mann-Whitney test), and r2 (p {\textless} 0.005). This finding suggests that model calibration only to the basin outlet may mask compensation of positive and negative errors of source and transportation processes. We conclude by advocating a number of new directions for distributed watershed modeling, including in-depth uncertainty analysis and the use of additional information, not necessarily related to model end points, to constrain parameter estimation. {\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {An intensive snow-cover survey at Lake Laflamme, Quebec, during the spring of 1983 showed that wet deposition in the form of rain, which was a dominant phenomenon during the 1983 melt season, gave rise, according to the intensity and chemical quality of the precipitation, to both losses and gains of ion loads (meq m−2) in the snowpack. Mean values for the daily wet deposition loadings (meq m−2 d−1) of ionic species associated with atmospheric aerosols (H+, , ) were of approximately the same magnitude as the daily changes in gains recorded in the snow cover during the melt period. In contrast, the mean value for the contribution by wet deposition to the total loads of K+ and  in the snow cover was far outweighed by the gains which were observed at the same time. The expected losses for the snowpack, calculated from the sum of the total loads stocked in the pack at the beginning of the melt period and the total loads in precipitation during the melt period, were lower than the sum of the actual losses observed for all ionic species except H+. The increases ({\%}) in the loads for the major anions Cl−,  and  were comparable (25 to 32{\%}). The results suggested that dry deposition either directly by aerosol interaction with the snow cover or indirectly by adsorption on organic material followed by leaching during the melt period, or by a combination of both, was a major factor in the increases observed. The values for the increases in loads for Ca2+, , Mg2+ and Na+ (50 to 287{\%}) probably represented, in addition to leaching of local debris, the exudates of cellular material from the cell plasmolysis of detrital organic debris. High rates of in-pack production, however, were characteristic of Al3+. Mn2+, K+ and  which showed substantial increases in pack loads (480 to 750{\%}). These increases cannot be accounted for by any local phenomena other than the dissolution or microbiological degradation of organic debris. It is suggested that ion exchange capacity of both particulate and soluble organic material led to a decrease in pack acidity; this phenomenon should thus be considered as a major factor in all attempts to model acid rain fluxes through boreal forest systems.},

abstract = {The snow cover model SNOWPACK includes a detailed model of snow microstructure and metamorphism. In SNOWPACK, the complex texture of snow is described using the four primary microstructure parameters: grain size, bond size, dendricity and sphericity. For each parameter, rate equations are developed that predict the development in time as a function of the environmental conditions. The rate equations are based on theoretical considerations such as mixture theory and on empirical relations. With a classification scheme, the conventional snow grain types are predicted on the basis of those parameters. The approach to link the bulk constitutive properties, viscosity and thermal conductivity to microstructure parameters is novel to the field of snow cover modeling. Expanding on existing knowledge on microstructure-based viscosity and thermal conductivity, a complete description of those quantities applicable to the seasonal snow cover is presented. This includes the strong coupling between physical processes in snow: The bond size, which changes not only through metamorphic processes but also through the process of pressure sintering (included in our viscosity formulation), is at the same time the single most important parameter for snow viscosity and thermal conductivity. Laboratory results are used to illustrate the performance of the formulations presented. The numerical implementation is treated in the companion paper Part I. A more complete evaluation for the entire model is found in the companion paper Part III.},

abstract = {An increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 from 280 ppmv in 1750 to 367 ppmv in 1999 is attributed to emissions from fossil fuel combustion estimated at 270 +/- 30 Pg C and land use change at 136 +/- 55 Pg. Of the emissions from land use change, 78 +/- 12 Pg is estimated from depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Most agricultural soils have lost 50 to 70{\%} of their original SOC pool, and the depletion is exacerbated by further soil degradation and desertification. The restoration of degraded soils, conversion of agriculturally marginal lands to appropriate land use, and the adoption of recommended management practices on agricultural soils can reverse degradative trends and lead to SOC sequestration. Technological options for SOC sequestration on agricultural soils include adoption of conservation tillage, use of manures, and compost as per integrated nutrient management and precision fanning strategies, conversion of monoculture to complex diverse cropping systems, meadow-based rotations and winter cover crops, and establishing perennial vegetation on contours and steep slopes. The global potential of SOC sequestration and restoration of degraded/desertified soils is estimated at 0.6 to 1.2 Pg C/y for about 50 years with a cumulative sink capacity of 30 to 60 Pg. The SOC sequestration is a cost-effective strategy of mitigating the climate change during the first 2 to 3 decades of the 21(st) century. While improving soil quality, biomass productivity and enhanced environment quality, the strategy of SOC sequestration also buys us time during which the non-carbon fuel alternatives can take effect.},

abstract = {Conventional wisdom postulates that leaching losses of N from agriculture systems are dominated by NO(3)(-). Although the export of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) into the groundwater has been recognized for more than 100 yr, it is often ignored when total N budgets are constructed. Leaching of DON into stream and drinking water reservoirs leads to eutrophication and acidification, and can pose a potential risk to human health. The main objective of this review was to determine whether DON losses from agricultural systems are significant, and to what extent they pose a risk to human health and the environment. Dissolved organic N losses across agricultural systems varied widely with minimum losses of 0.3 kg DON ha(-1)yr(-1) in a pasture to a maximum loss of 127 kg DON ha(-1)yr(-1) in a grassland following the application of urine. The mean and median values for DON leaching losses were found to be 12.7 and 4.0 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1), respectively. On average, DON losses accounted for 26{\%} of the total soluble N (NO(3)(-) plus DON) losses, with a median value of 19{\%}. With a few exceptions, DON concentrations exceeded the criteria recommendations for drinking water quality. The extent of DON losses increased with increasing precipitation/irrigation, higher total inputs of N, and increasing sand content. It is concluded that DON leaching can be an important N loss pathway from agricultural systems. Models used to simulate and predict N losses from agricultural systems should include DON losses.},

abstract = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e.g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.},

abstract = {The soil water assessment tool (SWAT) is a hydrologic model originally developed to evaluate water resources in large agricultural basins. SWAT was not designed to model heterogeneous mountain basins typical of the western United States, and as a result, has performed poorly when applied to mountainous locations. The intent of this study was to increase the versatility of SWAT by developing the capability to simulate hydrology of a non-agricultural mountainous region with a large snowmelt component. A western Wyoming basin, representative of Rocky Mountain basins, was selected to evaluate model performance, identify governing hydrologic processes, and improve the snowmelt routine. An initial evaluation of SWAT performance indicated an inability of the model to represent snowmelt processes. Based on simulation results and field observations, algorithms were developed which use elevation bands to distribute temperature and precipitation with elevation. Additional routines which control snowpack temperature, meltwater production, and areal snow coverage were designed to simulate the influence of season and elevation on the evolution of basin snowpack. The development of the new snowmelt algorithms improved the average annual Nash–Sutcliffe R2 correlation between simulated and observed Wind River streamflow from an initial value of −0.70 to +0.86.},

There is increasing evidence thatoverwinter climate can influence biogeochemical cycling belowground,perhaps by disrupting this synchrony. In this study, we experimentallyreduced snow accumulation in northern hardwood forest plots to examinethe effects of soil freezing on the dynamics of fine roots ({\textless} 1 mm diameter)measured using minirhizotrons. Snow removal treatment during therelatively mild winters of 1997–1998 and 1998–1999 induced mild freezingtemperatures (to −4 °C) lasting approximately three months atshallow soil depths (to −30 cm) in sugar maple and yellow birch stands.This treatment resulted in elevated overwinter fine root mortality in treatedcompared to reference plots of both species, and led to an earlier peak infine root production during the subsequent growing season. These shiftsin fine root dynamics increased fine root turnover but were not largeenough to significantly alter fine root biomass. No differences inmorality response were found between species. Laboratory tests on pottedtree seedlings exposed to controlled freezing regimes confirmed that mildfreezing temperatures (to −5 °C) were insufficient to directlyinjure winter-hardened fine roots of these species, suggesting that themarked response recorded in our forest plots was caused indirectly bymechanical damage to roots in frozen soil. Elevated fine root necromass intreated plots decomposed quickly, and may have contributed an excess fluxof about 0.5 g N/m2{\textperiodcentered}yr, which is substantial relative tomeasurements of N fluxes from these plots. Our results suggest elevatedoverwinter mortality temporarily reduced fine root length in treatmentplots and reduced plant uptake, thereby disrupting the temporalsynchrony between nutrient availability and uptake and enhancing ratesof nitrification. Increased frequency of soil freezing events, as may occurwith global change, could alter fine root dynamics within the northernhardwood forest disrupting the normally tight coupling between nutrientmineralization and uptake.},

abstract = {Large areas in Europe may experience frozen soils during winter periods which pose special challenges to modelling. Extensive data are collected in small agricultural catchments in Nordic and Baltic countries. An analysis on measurements, carried out in four small agricultural catchments has shown that a considerable amount of the yearly nutrient loss occurs during the freezing period. A freezing period was defined as the time period indicated by the maximum and minimum points on the cumulative degree-day curve. On average 6-32{\%} of the yearly runoff was generated during this period while N-loss varied from 5-35{\%} and P loss varied from 3-33{\%}. The results indicate that infiltration into frozen soils might occur during the freezing period and that the runoff generating processes, at least during a considerable part of the freezing period, are rather similar compared to the processes outside the freezing period. Freeze-thaw cycles affect the infiltration capacity and aggregate stability, thereby the erosion and nutrient losses. The Norwegian catchment had a high P loss during the freezing period compared to the other catchments, most likely caused by catchment characteristics such as slope, soil types, tillage methods and fertiliser application. It is proposed to use data, collected on small agricultural dominated catchments, in the calibration and validation of watershed management models and to take into account runoff and nutrient loss processes which are representative for cold climates, thereby obtaining reliable results.},

abstract = {Losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in land run-off and drainage from agricultural land can impair river water quality and may pose a potential health hazard. Losses of P are up to an order of magnitude smaller than those of N, but may be more significant with respect to freshwater eutrophication. At the field scale, research suggests that rates of nutrient loss are sensitive to both nutrient and land management, in particular, where nutrient inputs continuously exceed production requirements and where farming methods increase land vulnerability to run-off and erosion. A clear distinction can be made between N and P in the timescales over which inputs of these nutrients are buffered by terrestrial ecosystems against loss, which has implications for control strategies. At the river basin scale, any targets for reducing nutrient loss are best guided by site-specific information on their likely ecological impact, but this information rarely exists for UK rivers affected by eutrophication, and only general guidelines are available. True management of the environment requires integrated approaches which include both N and P taking account of differences in their source areas and delivery mechanisms, the vulnerability of land use and adoption of safe management options in relation to landscape characteristics and the sensitivity of the watercourse along its reach. For P, the identification of vulnerable zones represents a step forward to the management of the river basin in smaller definable units, which can provide a focus for safe management practices. This requires a better understanding of the linkages between nutrient sources, transport and impacts and is considered an urgent research priority. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Specifically, mid-winter rain-on-snow (ROS) events are a major source of NO3–N export to forested streams, but the impact of these events on other nutrients is not known. Climate projections for Ontario suggest that climate warming will be most pronounced during the winter months, which could result in more mid-winter rain events and consequent changes in nutrient delivery to streams. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of winter climate variability on the timing of NO3–N export relative to water and other nutrients at six headwater catchments in south-central Ontario that have long-term water quality and hydrology records (1980–2002). The catchments represent a wide range of physiographic characteristics and stream chemistry, yet the timing of nitrate export from all catchments was coherent. In warmer winters with more ROS events, the bulk of NO3–N export relative to the export of water shifted earlier in the year from spring (i.e. the main period of snow melt) to winter. ROS events did not cause similar temporal shifts in the export of other nutrients, including dissolved organic carbon, total phosphorus and calcium. Instead, their export was synchronous with the bulk of water export. Future shifts to earlier export of NO3–N relative to water and other nutrients may impact aquatic productivity and cause more frequent episodic acidification of surface waters.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Nutrient loss from Saskatchewan cropland and pasture in spring snowmelt runoff. Can. J. Soil Sci. 93: 445–458. To develop appropriate beneficial management practices (BMPs) for a watershed, it is essential to quantify the nutrients lost from agricultural fields and to identify the mechanisms of nutrient transport. To determine appropriate BMPs for a watershed in southeastern Saskatchewan, nutrient concentrations were measured in spring 2010 in snowmelt runoff from fertilized annual cropland (zero till) and perennial tame pastures. The majority of nutrient loss was in dissolved form, rather than as particulates. Significantly more nitrogen (N) was lost from pastures as dissolved ammonium than from cropland, while significantly more dissolved organic N was lost from croplands. Although there were no significant differences in total phosphorus (P) loss, there were significantly higher co...},

abstract = {Nonpoint source modeling using hydrological models has been extensively studied at agriculture and urban watersheds; however, this has not been well addressed in forested ones where agricultural sources are comparatively minimal and nitrogen deposition exerts remarkable impacts on the nutrient cycles of a catchment. Thus it is critically important for hydrological models to incorporate the dynamics of nitrogen deposition and its transport processes, for reasonable nitrogen modeling. This is especially so for the Canadian Shield, which is characterized by a cold climate and special physiographic features. A revision of Soil and Water Assessment Tool for Canadian Shield (SWAT-CS) was proposed by Fu et al. (2014) to better characterize the hydrological features. In this study, more revisions were added to better simulate processes of nitrate by: 1) incorporating the dynamics of nitrogen deposition; and 2) allowing the deposition to distribute along with rapid-moving macropore flows. The newly revised model, SWAT-CSenm (SWAT-CS with an Enhanced Nitrate Module), and SWAT-CS were calibrated and tested with data of a subbasin of Harp Lake in south-central Ontario for 1990 to 2007. Modeling performance of nitrate flux rate in the stream for SWAT-CSenm was nearly acceptable with maximum daily Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (ENSs) for calibration and validation periods of 0.66 and 0.43, respectively; whereas the result of SWAT-CS was generally unsatisfied with maximum daily ENSs of 0.16 and 0.07, respectively. An uncertainty analysis using GLUE (generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation) showed a modest performance as about 50{\%} of observations can be incorporated by the 95{\%} prediction range deriving from the behavioral solutions (ENS ≥ 0.5) for both daily and monthly simulations. It is concluded that the enhanced nitrate module improved the model performance of SWAT-CS on nitrate modeling, since the previous SWAT-CS failed to consider the effect of dynamics of nitrogen deposition and its sequential processes at the investigated site.},

abstract = {Projected global warming may result in colder soil temperatures and a greater number of soil freezing and thawing cycles (FTC) during the winter in cool temperate and high-latitude regions. We evaluated the effects of seasons and repeated FTC on soil P availability in the topsoil of no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems. In order to determine P availability during fall 2007 and spring 2008, soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected in both seasons from a long-term corn-soybean rotation experiment in plots that received 0, 17.5 and 35 kg P ha-1 and 160 kg N ha-1 every 2 yr since 1992. In addition, soil cores (0-5 cm) were collected in fall 2007 in plots that received 35 kg P ha-1 and 160 kg N ha-1 every 2 yr and were enriched or not with 2 g of soybean residues. Under controlled conditions, the cores were subjected to various FTC treatments, with each cycle consisting of 5 d of freezing and 5 d of thawing. The water-extractable P (Pw) and Mehlich-3 extractable P (PM3) contents were higher in soil samples collected in the spring compared with those collected the previous fall. After one and three FTC, Pw values averaged 17.4 mg kg-1 in NT and 7.5 mg kg-1 in CT and were not influenced by the addition of soybean residues. At the end of the sixth FTC, the Pw content of soil cores collected in NT increased up to 25.9 mg kg-1 with the addition of residues but decreased in the absence of residues. The effects of freezing and thawing on soil cores with crop residues occurred at the end of the sixth FTC, where P M3 in the NT + residues treatment increased twofold, reaching 100 mg P kg-1. These results confirm that both Pw and PM3 in NT can be enhanced by increasing the number of FTC.},

Since its original release in 2002, the model structure and equations have been significantly altered during several development phases. Here, we provide the first full model description since 2002 and then test the latest version of the model (v1.4.4) in a small rural catchment in northeast Scotland. The particulate phosphorus simulation was much improved compared to previous model versions, whilst the latest sorption equations allowed us to explore the potential time lags between reductions in terrestrial inputs and improvements in surface water quality, an issue of key policy relevance. The model is particularly suitable for use as a research tool, but should only be used to inform policy and land management in data-rich areas, where parameters and processes can be well-constrained. More long-term data is needed to parameterise dynamic models and test their predictions.},

The forms, measurement, and sorption processes of P in both soil and water are discussed. Soil test P, the most common soil P analysis, is described relative to other forms of soil P and its use for agricultural and environmental purposes is explained. Loss of soil P to water can occur in particulate forms with eroded surface soil and in soluble forms in runoff, soil interflow, and deep leaching. This paper discusses the relative importance of each transport pathway as affected by soil type and management. Soil P dynamics and water quality risks associated with fertilizer and manure application are illustrated with several examples. Finally, the paper reviews management practices that can effectively reduce the loss of agricultural P to surface waters.},

abstract = {Changes in nitrifier and denitrifier abundance, composition and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during the winter period in soils with spring application of nitrogen (N) as mineral fertilizer, cattle manure or poultry manure were evaluated. Soil samples were collected from an agricultural field in Eastern Canada during winters of 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. Surprisingly, N2O emission rates were up to 150 fold greater in the coldest dates compared to other dates for the two winters, however rates were similar among N sources. Abundance of nitrifiers (Nitrobacter-like nxrA, archaeal amoA) and denitrifiers (nirK, nirS) increased in March and April compared with other sampling dates. Nitrifier abundance (nxrA) was the greatest in soils amended with cattle manure, while denitrifiers (nirK, nirS) were more abundant in soils amended with poultry manure. Nitrifiers and denitrifiers showed different composition depending on sampling date and N sources in the two winters, suggesting that changes in environmental conditions and N sources both influenced these communities. Our findings demonstrate that N2O emissions occur at significant rates in snow covered agricultural soils. Moreover, the abundance and diversity of denitrifier and nitrifier communities evolved throughout winter and appeared to be influenced by soil conditions and N sources applied in the previous spring. ?? 2013 .},

abstract = {Excess nutrient loading from numerous sources (e.g., agricultural and urban run-off, treatment plant discharge, and streambank erosion) continues to adversely impact water resources, and determination of the cause(s) of accelerated nutrient enrichment has become a contentious and litigious issue in several US regions. This paper addresses one fundamental question: What are acceptable levels of nutrients in runoff from agricultural fields? It focuses on the field scale where farmers and ranchers make management decisions. Not answer-ing this question limits the effectiveness of on-farm management and policy alternatives to address agriculture's contribution. To answer the question, some might suggest " direct com-parison " with reference site data, existing criteria/standards, or measured data compilations. Alternatively, " indirect assessments " using soil test phosphorus (P) levels, P indices, field-scale models, or certainty programs might be suggested. Thus, to provide a scientific basis for pol-icy debate and management decisions related to nutrient runoff from agricultural fields, we evaluated " direct comparisons " with measured data from case studies and evaluated " indirect assessment " alternatives. While acknowledging that scientific challenges and practical realities exist for each alternative, we concluded that certainty programs offer the most promise for ensuring acceptable nutrient runoff, and that field-scale models linked with watershed deci-sion support tools are the most promising for assessing impacts on downstream water quality. Recognizing the reality that some nutrient loss is unavoidable from natural and anthropo-genic sources, agriculture, industry, and municipalities are each encouraged to commit to implementing enhanced management where needed to minimize their sector's contribution to excess nutrients in our nation's waters.},

abstract = {The unsaturated zone exerts a major control on the delivery of nutrients to Chalk streams, yet flow and transport processes in this complex, dual-porosity medium have remained controversial. A major challenge arises in characterising these processes, both at the detailed mechanistic level and at an appropriate level for inclusion within catchment-scale models for nutrient management. The lowland catchment research (LOCAR) programme in the UK has provided a unique set of comprehensively instrumented groundwater-dominated catchments. Of these, the Pang and Lambourn, tributaries of the Thames near Reading, have been a particular focus for research into subsurface processes and surface water–groundwater interactions. Data from LOCAR and other sources, along with a new dual permeability numerical model of the Chalk, have been used to explore the relative roles of matrix and fracture flow within the unsaturated zone and resolve conflicting hypotheses of response. From the improved understanding gained through these explorations, a parsimonious conceptualisation of the general response of flow and transport within the Chalk unsaturated zone was formulated. This paper summarises the modelling and data findings of these explorations, and describes the integration of the new simplified unsaturated zone representation with a catchment-scale model of nutrients (INCA), resulting in a new model for catchment-scale flow and transport within Chalk systems: INCA-Chalk. This model is applied to the Lambourn, and results, including hindcast and forecast simulations, are presented. These clearly illustrate the decadal time-scales that need to be considered in the context of nutrient management and the EU Water Framework Directive.},

abstract = {In an effort to understand sources of nitrate (NO,) in surface waters of high-elevation catchments, nitrogen (N) transformations in and under seasonal snow were investigated from 1993 to 1995 on Niwot Ridge, an alpine ecosystem at 3,500 m located in the Colorado Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Ammonium (NH4+) and NO3- labeled with N-15 applied as nonconservative tracers to the snow showed no evidence of nitrification in the snowpack. Furthermore, NH4+ movement through the amended snowpack was highly correlated with a conservative chloride tracer (r(2) = 0.99). In an unamended snowpack NH4+ concentrations in meltwater before contact with the ground Rem highly correlated with NO; concentrations (r(2) = 0.98), which is consistent with no nitrification in the snowpack. The isotopically labeled (NH4+)-N-15 applied to the snowpack was found in underlying soils, showing that NH4+ released from snow can be rapidly immobilized. Resin bag (mixed-bed ion-exchange resins) measurements (n = 22) showed that 80{\%} of the mobile inorganic N in unamended subnivial soils was NO3-. Measurements of KCl-extractable inorganic N from surface soils showed that highest values were prior to the initiation of snowmelt and lowest values were during the growing season. The natural delta(15)N abundance of unamended soils was negative and ranged from -12 to -2, suggesting that atmospheric deposition of delta(15)N-depleted N is an important component of N cycling in these alpine soils. These results suggest that soil mineralization under seasonal snow, rather than snowmelt release of NO3-, may control NO3- concentrations in surface waters of high-elevation catchments.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal trends in nutrient concentrations and loads were analyzed for three rivers in the Red River watershed, Manitoba, Canada to determine changes in nutrient export across hydrologic seasons and along river continua in the Great Plains. Annual patterns in all three rivers were strongly influenced by the snowmelt period: 25–89 {\%} of the total annual river volume, 42–92 {\%} of the total annual TP load, and 41–81 {\%} of the total annual TN load were delivered during snowmelt. Concentrations of TP and TN varied among the hydrologic seasons (snowmelt, summer, fall, and winter), but showed more variability and larger values during winter and snowmelt, with peak values reaching 1.960 mg TP L−1 and 16.07 mg TN L−1. Although the flat topography and semi-arid climate of the Red River watershed results in hydrological disconnects along river continua, discharge and nutrient export increased along the three river gradients. In contrast, TP or TN concentrations showed no significant longitudinal change for the two agriculturally dominated watersheds yet increased along the forested stream. Our finding that TP and TN exports from northern Great Plains rivers are strongly influenced by seasonal hydrology, with snowmelt being a critical period for nutrient export has implications for design and implementation of appropriate management practices to minimize nutrient export to proximal and downstream aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {The last two decades have seen significant advances in understanding the cycling of carbon and nutrients in ecosystems characterized by seasonal snow cover. This paper reviews and summarizes work on the interactions between seasonal snow cover, soil physico-chemical characteristics, biological activity, and plot- to ecosystem-scale carbon and nitrogen cycling. The magnitude of winter biogeochemical activity is considerable. For example, including these winter fluxes into annual estimates of net ecosystem exchange reduces annual carbon uptake by 50{\%} or more in many ecosystems. The primary climatic control on these fluxes is the amount and timing of precipitation, especially the formation of a consistent seasonal snow cover. Consistent snow cover limits frost damage and controls both the timing and amount of liquid water in soil and the availability of labile carbon substrates. Together, liquid water and labile carbon control the magnitude of in situ activity, exchanges of CO2 and trace gases, and export of dissolved nutrients. The importance of snow cover to biogeochemical fluxes has led a renewed interest in how spatial variability in vegetation structure influences snow cover through shading, wind sheltering, and interception. Changes in snow cover associated with ongoing changes in both temperature and precipitation have the potential to profoundly impact the soil environment during winter and spring with unclear effects on annual and longer-term patterns of carbon and nitrogen cycling.},

To further investigate substrate limitation in these alpine soils, respiration after substrate addition was measured for samples from three sites in Colorado. In general, the abundance of microbes in these soils is positively correlated with soil water content. However, Per{\'{u}} talus soils had higher average microbial biomass than Colorado soils despite the Per{\'{u}} soils being higher in altitude and drier than the Colorado sites. Furthermore, the activity of the heterotrophic portion of the microbial community appears to be limited first by carbon and then by phosphorus as indicated both by results from extracellular enzyme assays and substrate addition experiments.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the development and testing of snow algorithms with specific reference to their use and application in land surface models, New algorithms, developed by the authors, for estimating snow interception in forest canopies, blowing snow transport and sublimation, snow cover depletion and open environment snowmelt are compared with field measurements. Existing algorithms are discussed and compared with field observations. Recommendations are made with respect to: (a) density of new and aged snow in open and forest environments; (b) interception of snow by evergreen canopies; (c) redistribution and sublimation of snow water equivalent by blowing snow; (d) depletion in snow-covered area during snowmelt; (e) albedo decay during snowmelt; (f) turbulent transfer during snowmelt; and (g) soil heat flux during meltwater infiltration into frozen soils. Preliminary evidence is presented, suggesting that one relatively advanced land surface model, CLASS, significantly underestimates the timing of snowmelt and snowmelt rates in open environments despite overestimating radiation and turbulent contributions to melt. The cause(s) may be due to overestimation of ground heat loss and other factors. It is recommended that further studies of snow energetics and soil heat transfer in frozen soils be undertaken to provide improvements for land surface models such as CLASS, with particular attention paid to establishing the reliability of the models in invoking closure of the energy equation.

abstract = {The INCA (Integrated Nitrogen in Catchments) model was applied to the River Tweed in the Scottish Borders, a large-scale (4400km(2)), spatially heterogeneous catchment, draining a wide range of agricultural land-use types, and which contributes approximately 20{\%} of UK river flows to the North Sea. The model was calibrated for the first four years' data record (1994 to 1997) and tested over the following three years (1998 to 2000), The model calibration and testing periods incorporated a high degree of variability in climatic conditions and river flows within the Tweed catchment. The ability of the INCA model to reproduce broad-scale spatial patterns and seasonal dynamics in river flows and nitrate concentrations suggests that the processes controlling first order variability in river water nitrate concentrations have been represented successfully within the model. The tendency of the model to overestimate summer/early autumn baseflow nitrate concentrations during dry years may be linked to the operation of aquatic plant uptake effects. It is, therefore, suggested that consideration be given to incorporating a spatially and temporally variable in- stream plant uptake term for the application of INCA to lowland eutrophic rivers. Scenarios to examine possible impacts of environmental change on nitrate concentrations on the Tweed are examined, These include the effects of (i) implementing different recommendations for fertiliser use and land use change under the Nitrate Sensitive Areas (NSA) Scheme and the Scottish Code of Good Agricultural Practice, (ii) worst case scenario changes linked to a dramatic reduction in livestock numbers as a result of a crisis in UK livestock farming and (iii) changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition.},

abstract = {Controlled melting of snowpacks in the laboratory demonstrates the importance of the initial distribution of chemical species within the pack (mesoscale) and within the snow grains (microscale) to the timing and relative concentrations of meltwater released from the base of the pack. Acid and salt tracers were applied to homogeneous snow in order to investigate these effects. Species deposited near the top of the pack eluted out considerably before those more uniformly distributed with depth. Also, about 80{\%} of the salts dosed at the top of a 0.4-m pack were removed in the first 20{\%} of the meltwater, versus 70{\%} of a salt dosed at middepth. Both the top and middepth tracers were present in the first fractions of meltwater draining from the pack, however, indicating that there is partial mixing of percolating meltwater with solutes in an immobile surface phase on grains deeper in the pack. Concentration of species on the outside of grains by seasonal metamorphism and on the outside of multigrain particles and clusters during melt freeze will enhance their early removal. Different ions that were present in the snow with the same mesoscale and microscale conditions prior to melt came out at the same relative concentrations; i.e., they did not exhibit preferential elution.},

abstract = {Meltwater reaching the base of the snowpack may either infiltrate the underlying stratum, run off, or refreeze, forming a basal ice layer. Frozen ground underneath a melting snowpack constrains infiltration promoting runoff and refreezing. Compositional changes in chemistry take place for each of these flowpaths as a result of phase change, contact between meltwater and soil, and mixing between meltwater and soil water. Meltwater ion concentrations and infiltration rate into frozen soils both decline rapidly as snowmelt progresses. Their temporal association is highly non-linear and the covariance must be compensated for in order to use time-averaged values to calculate chemical infiltration over a melt event. This temporal covariance is termed ‘enhanced infiltration' and represents the additional ion load that infiltrates due to the timing of high meltwater ion concentration and infiltration rate. Both theoretical and experimental assessments of the impact of enhanced infiltration showed that it causes a greater ion load to infiltrate leading to relative dilute runoff water. Sensitivity analysis showed that the magnitude of enhanced infiltration is governed by initial snow water equivalent, average melt rate, and meltwater ion concentration factor. Based on alterations in water chemistry due to various effects, including enhanced infiltration, three major flowpaths could be distinguished: overland flow, organic interflow, and mineral interflow. Laboratory experiments were carried out in a temperature-controlled environment to identify compositional changes in water from these flowpaths. Samples of meltwater, runoff, and interflow were filtered and analyzed for major anions and cations. Chemical signatures for each flowpath were determined by normalizing runoff and interflow concentrations using meltwater concentrations. Results showed that changes in ion concentrations were most significant for H+, NO3 –, NH4 +, Mg2+, and Ca2+. Repeated flushes of meltwater through each interflowpath caused a washout of ions. In the field, samples of soil water and ponding water were collected daily from a Rocky Mountain hillslope during snowmelt. Their normalized chemical compositions were compared to the laboratory-identified signatures to evaluate the flowpath. The majority of the flowpaths sampled had chemical signatures, which indicated mineral interflow, only 10{\%} showed unmixed organic interflow.},

The model was run as an array of connected profiles cascading to the brook. For three winter seasons (1995–98) it was able to predict the onset and total accumulation of the runoff with satisfactory accuracy. Surface runoff was identified as only a minor fraction of the total runoff occurring during short periods in connection with ice blocking of the water-conducting pores. Little surface runoff, though, does not mean that soil frost is unimportant for spring runoff. Simulations without frost routines systematically underestimated the total accumulated runoff. The possibility of major frost effects appearing in response to specific combinations of weather conditions were also tested. Different scenarios of critical initial conditions for the winter, e.g. high water saturation and delayed snow accumulation leading to an increased frost penetration, were tested. These showed that under special circumstances there is potential for increased spring runoff due to soil frost.},

abstract = {The physical nature of sediment transport favors the movement of smaller and less dense materials, typically resulting in greater (enriched) sediment total phosphorus (TP) and organic matter (OM) concentrations than those of the parent soil. In rainfall–runoff, residue cover significantly influenced P enrichment, with the median TP enrichment ratio (TPER) for corn-grain (1.4) being significantly greater (p=0.007) than that for corn-silage (0.8) and manured corn-silage (1.0) fields, which were similar. While greater P enrichment was observed in snowmelt compared to rainfall–runoff, attributable to correspondingly high OMER values, TPER was unaffected by treatment differences (p=0.60). The OM enrichment was much higher ({\~{}}10×) during snowmelt (9.7) compared to rainfall–runoff (0.97). Low flow rates over frozen surfaces may have favored enhanced transport of OM and clay-sized particles in snowmelt. Crop residue contributions from corn-grain systems favor greater transport of organic P forms (i.e., low dissolved reactive P/total dissolved P ratios) whereas inorganic P dominance was observed in silage fields. Additional intra-event runoff data generated for fields with different crop-row orientations (contour vs. up-and-down the slope) provided more insights into the temporal dynamics of P enrichment process. The TPER values were generally inversely related to flow rate and soil loss. This study addresses crucial knowledge/information gaps on the role played by the mode of runoff generation (rainfall–runoff vs. snowmelt) and field roughness conditions (due to crop residue, crop-row orientations) on P enrichment from row-cropped agricultural systems.},

abstract = {Testing of the Integrated Nitrogen model for Catchments (INCA) in a wide range of ecosystem types across Europe has shown that the model underestimates N transformation processes to a large extent in northern catchments of Finland and Norway in winter and spring. It is found, and generally assumed, that microbial activity in soils proceeds at low rates at northern latitudes during winter, even at sub-zero temperatures. The INCA model was modified to improve the simulation of N transformation rates in northern catchments, characterised by cold climates and extensive snow accumulation and insulation in winter, by introducing an empirical function to simulate soil temperatures below the seasonal snow pack, and a degree-day model to calculate the depth of the snow pack. The proposed snow-correction factor improved the simulation of soil temperatures at Finnish and Norwegian field sites in winter, although soil temperature was still underestimated during periods with a thin snow cover. Finally, a comparison between the modified INCA version (v.1.7) and the former version (v.1.6) was made at the Simojoki river basin in northern Finland and at Dalelva Brook in northern Norway.

abstract = {Lakes and streams in Class 1 wilderness areas in the western United States (U.S.) are at risk from atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S), and protection of these resources is mandated under the Federal Clean Air Act and amendments. Assessment of critical loads, which are the maximum exposure to pollution an area can receive without adverse effects on sensitive ecosystems, requires accurate deposition estimates. However, deposition is difficult and expensive to measure in high-elevation wilderness, and spatial patterns in N and S deposition in these areas remain poorly quantified. In this study, ion-exchange resin (IER) collectors were used to measure dissolved inorganic N (DIN) and S deposition during June 2006-September 2007 at approximately 20 alpine/subalpine sites spanning the Continental Divide in Rocky Mountain National Park. Results indicated good agreement between deposition estimated from IER collectors and commonly used wet+dry methods during summer, but poor agreement during winter. Snowpack sampling was found to be a more accurate way of quantifying DIN and S deposition during winter. Summer DIN deposition was significantly greater on the east side of the park than on the west side (25-50{\%}; p≤0.03), consistent with transport of pollutants to the park from urban and agricultural areas to the east. Sources of atmospheric nitrate (NO3-) were examined using N isotopes. The average $\delta$15N of NO3-from IER collectors was 3.5‰ higher during winter than during summer (p{\textless}0.001), indicating a seasonal shift in the relative importance of regional NOxsources, such as coal combustion and vehicular sources of atmospheric NO3-. There were no significant differences in $\delta$15N of NO3-between east and west sides of the park during summer or winter (p=0.83), indicating that the two areas may have similar sources of atmospheric NO3-. Results from this study indicate that a combination of IER collectors and snowpack sampling can be used to characterize spatial variability in DIN and S deposition in high-elevation wilderness areas. These data can improve our ability to model critical loads by filling gaps in geographic coverage of deposition monitoring/modeling programs and thus may enable policy makers to better protect sensitive natural resources in Class 1 Wilderness areas.},

abstract = {Temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of surface runoff generation triggers the dynamics of source areas of sediment and sediment-associated nutrient transport. Reliable modelling of hydrological special situations i.e. snowmelt is of high importance for the quality of erosion and sediment yield modelling. Data from the research catchment Sch{\"{a}}fertal demonstrate the individuality of snowmelt events in terms of runoff coefficient and delivery ratio. This 1.44 km2 low mountain catchment is characterised by a high portion of arable land with a winter grain/winter rape crop rotation. The integrated winter erosion and nutrient load model (IWAN) considers these dynamic aspects by coupling a hydrological model with a sediment load model. Cell size of this raster-based approach is 10×10 m2. Additionally, snowmelt rill erosion is simulated with a newly developed physically based model that is firstly applied on a catchment scale. A sensitivity analysis of this model system component demonstrates the plausibility of the model approach and the overall robustness of the model system IWAN. The results of the long-term hydrological modelling from 1991 to 2003 are reliable and form the basis for the simulation of six snowmelt events which were observed in the Sch{\"{a}}fertal catchment. The estimated total runoff volumes for these events match the observations well. The modelled overland runoff coefficients vary from 0.001 to 0.72. The mean values of cell erosion, which were modelled with one set of parameters for all six events range from 0.0006 to 0.96 t ha−1. The total modelled erosion for the events with unfrozen soil and low amount of surface runoff is of a factor 50 below those with partly frozen soil. In addition to these distinctions, the major differences are caused by flow accumulation in shallow depressions in variable parts of the catchment. However, the validation of these results on the single event scale is restricted due to limited spatial data. Total simulated sediment yield at the catchment outlet was as high as 13.84 t which underestimates the observed values, with the exception of one event. Oversimplification of the modelled channel processes may be a reason. The temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of the surface roughness parameter, which was identified to be sensitive, also causes uncertainty in the parameter estimation. Despite these findings, the model system IWAN was applied successfully on the catchment scale and the simulated results are reliable.},

abstract = {The development of the seasonal snow cover is entirely driven by atmospheric forcing. SNOWPACK uses measured snow depths to determine snow precipitation rates via the calculated settling rates. This requires a rigid data control algorithm. A new statistical model is used to estimate fresh snow density as a function of the measured atmospheric conditions. A statistical model is also derived for the snow albedo, which is necessary to determine the absorbed radiation. The surface sensible and latent heat flux parameterizations are derived from Monin–Obukhov similarity and include a formulation for wind pumping. The formulations will also adapt to drifting snow conditions. The new suggestion is consistent with the observation of different roughness lengths for scalars and momentum over snow. An accurate formulation, especially for the latent heat exchange, is crucial because latent heat exchange determines the formation of surface hoar, a very important weak layer. We also account for the effect of wind pumping on the thermal conductivity in the uppermost snow layers. The surface energy and mass exchange formulations are evaluated by looking at the formation of the important thin layers surface hoar and melt–freeze crusts in SNOWPACK. Those layers are well simulated. In addition, the complete snow profile development is modeled successfully for the parameters grain type, temperature, density, grain size and liquid water content. An overall score between 0 and 1 is used to describe the profile agreement with observations and an average score of over 0.8 is reached.},

Historic snow course snowpack density observations were analyzed within a multiple linear regression snow density model to estimate SWE directly from snow depth measurements. Snow surveys were completed on or about 1 April 2011 and 2012 and combined with NRCS operational measurements to investigate the spatial variability of SWE near peak snow accumulation. Bivariate relations and multiple linear regression models were developed to understand the relation of snow density and SWE with terrain variables (derived using a geographic information system (GIS)). Snow density variability was best explained by day of year, snow depth, UTM Easting, and elevation. Calculation of SWE directly from snow depth measurement using the snow density model has strong statistical performance, and model validation suggests the model is transferable to independent data within the bounds of the original data set. This pathway of estimating SWE directly from snow depth measurement is useful when evaluating snowpack properties at the basin scale, where many time-consuming measurements of SWE are often not feasible. A comparison with a previously developed snow density model shows that calibrating a snow density model to a specific basin can provide improvement of SWE estimation at this scale, and should be considered for future basin scale analyses. During both water year (WY) 2011 and 2012, elevation and location (UTM Easting and/or UTM Northing) were the most important SWE model variables, suggesting that orographic precipitation and storm track patterns are likely driving basin scale SWE variability. Terrain curvature was also shown to be an important variable, but to a lesser extent at the scale of interest.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We combine 3years of available data in the Ciliwung River, the major river flowing through Jakarta, with a distributed river–aquifer interaction model to characterise the impact of urbanisation on the N-cycle of both surface and groundwater systems. Results show that the N-cycle in the river–aquifer system is heterogeneous in space, seasonal dependent (i.e. flow regime) and strongly affected by urban pollution. Results suggest also that although the main sources of N related groundwater pollution are leaking septic tanks, the aquifer interaction with the Ciliwung River may locally have a strong effect on the concentrations. In the general context of pollution control in urban areas, this study demonstrates how advanced process-based models can be efficiently used in combination with field measurements to bring new insights into complex contamination problems.

abstract = {A number of previous studies have reported the existence of a minimum in phosphate solubility between pH 5.5 and 7 in non-calcareous soils. Different hypotheses have been forwarded to explain this phenomenon. In this study, ten soil samples with varying textures and phosphorus status were subjected to batch experiments in which dissolved phosphate was measured as a function of pH and phosphate load. Soil samples with more than 20{\%} clay all had a minimum phosphate solubility between pH 6 and 7, whereas for samples with {\textless}10{\%} clay, no such minimum was observed. Further experiments involving additions of phosphate and arsenate showed an increasing adsorption of these anions with decreasing pH also below pH 6 in clay soils, suggesting that the pH dependence on adsorption and desorption in short-term experiments was not the same. Kinetic experiments showed that the increased phosphate desorption at lower pH values in non-calcareous clay soils was a quick process, which is consistent with adsorption/desorption being the most important mechanism governing the retention and release of inorganic P. Moreover, by comparing extraction results with batch experiment results for samples from a long-term fertility experiment, it was concluded that more than 60{\%} of the accumulated phosphate was occluded, i.e. not reactive within 6days. Additional evidence for an important role of occluded phosphate comes from an analysis of the Freundlich sorption isotherms for the studied soils. It is hypothesized that interlayered hydroxy-Al and hydroxy-Fe polymers in clay minerals may be important for P dynamics in clay soils by trapping some of the P in an occluded form. The results also suggest that improved knowledge on the speciation and dynamics of phosphorus in soils is required for consistent mechanistically based modeling of phosphate sorption/desorption reactions.},

The aquitard system consists of 80 m of uniform, plastic clay-rich Battleford till (deposited 12-18 ka BP) disconformably overlying 77 m of late Cretaceous plastic marine clay (Snakebite Member, deposited 70-72 Ma BP).

abstract = {The impact of observed changes in air temperature and precipitation from 1969 to 2013 and climate projections for 2050 and 2080 at Ny-{\AA}lesund, an arctic research station on Spitzbergen Island in the Svalbard Archipelago on snow hydrological processes, were analyzed using snow accumulation and ablation algorithms in the physically based Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM). The climate projections were obtained from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), with a focus on the snow-dominated period (October to June). To identify the potential effects of increasing temperature and precipitation, a model sensitivity analysis (1°C to 5°C), with and without a 25{\%} increase in precipitation, was run on CRHM snow processes. The results indicated that the greatest observed warming was during the early snow season (October–February), with increases of 0.8 and 0.9°C decade−1 for maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures, respectively. There was also a significant increase in annual and winter precipitation (24mm decade−1). The late snow season (March–June) also had a marked increase in temperature (0.5 and 0.69°C decade−1 for Tmax and Tmin respectively), but no significant change in precipitation. These changes lead to a significant increase in the number of days with rainfall rather than snowfall. The sensitivity analysis indicated that mean snow water equivalent snowpack will decrease by 10.2{\%} (early snow season) and 11.1{\%} (late snow season) per degree of increased air temperature. For each degree of temperature increase, the modelled peak snow-water-equivalent (SWE) declined by 6.9{\%}, duration of snowpack declined 11days, and the number of days with rain increased 43{\%} for the early snow season and 12.8{\%} for the late snow season. A warmer climate also leads to markedly decreased surface snow sublimation and the fraction of snowfall eroded and transported by blowing snow. For most snowpack parameters analyzed, the response to warming accelerates with increased warming, especially above 3°C. A 25{\%} increase in precipitation partially counteracted the response to warming, with the greatest effect on peak SWE.},

abstract = {Algorithms to calculate the threshold wind speed and the effect of exposed vegetation on saltation and to describe vertical profiles of humidity in blowing snow, permit the calculation of point blowing snow transport and sublimation fluxes using standard meteorological and landcover data or simple interfaces with climate models. Blowing snow transport and sublimation fluxes can be upscaled to calculate open environment snow accumulation by accounting for their variability over open snow fields, increase in transport and sublimation with fetch, and the effect of exposed vegetation on partitioning the shear stress available to drive transport. Blowing snow fluxes scaled in this manner were used to calculate snow mass balance and to simulate seasonal snow accumulation at a southern Saskatchewan prairie and an arctic site. Field measurements at these sites indicated that from 48{\%} to 58{\%} of snowfall was removed by blowing snow before melt began. Simulations suggest that the ratios of snow removed and sublimated by blowing snow to that transported were 2∶1 and 1∶1 at the prairie and arctic sites respectively. The resulting methodology was capable of estimating winter season mass balances for these snowpacks that compared well with snowfall and snow accumulation measurements.},

abstract = {Oxygen-releasing plants may provide aerobic niches in anoxic sediments and soils for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The oxygen-releasing, aerenchymatous emergent macrophyte Glyceria maxima had a strong positive effect on numbers and activities of the nitrifying bacteria in its root zone in spring and early summer. The stimulation of the aerobic nitrifying bacteria in the freshwater sediment, ascribed to oxygen release by the roots of G. maxima, disappeared in late summer. Numbers and activities of the nitrifying bacteria were positively correlated, and a positive relationship with denitrification activities also was found. To assess possible adaptations of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria to low-oxygen or anoxic habitats, a comparison was made between the freshwater lake sediment and three soils differing in oxicity profiles. Oxygen kinetics and tolerance to anoxia of the ammonia-oxidizing communities from these habitats were determined. The apparent K(infm) values for oxygen of the ammonia-oxidizing community in the lake sediment were in the range of 5 to 15 (mu)M, which was substantially lower than the range of K(infm) values for oxygen of the ammonia-oxidizing community from a permanently oxic dune location. Upon anoxic incubation, the ammonia-oxidizing communities of dune, chalk grassland, and calcareous grassland soils lost 99, 95, and 92{\%} of their initial nitrifying capacity, respectively. In contrast, the ammonia-oxidizing community in the lake sediment started to nitrify within 1 h upon exposure to oxygen at the level of the initial capacity. It is argued that the conservation of the nitrifying capacity during anoxic periods and the ability to react instantaneously to the presence of oxygen are important traits of nitrifiers in fluctuating oxic-anoxic environments such as the root zone of aerenchymatous plant species.},

abstract = {Rapid urbanisation is transforming many urban rivers by affecting their hydraulic conditions and water quality. This process is particularly intense in some areas of the planet, where migratory phenomena and the associated urbanisation pace and conurbation are extreme. In these cases, the lack of water supply and sewerage infrastructures can lead to enormous pressure on urban river corridors, which often implies irreversible pollution of surface waters and shallow aquifers. In this article we address the problem of how integrated planning of urban river corridor management is essential to achieve sustainable solutions and how modern simulation tools can contribute to this effect. This is done by reporting about an exemplary case study, the Ciliwung River flowing through Jakarta, which is highly polluted and floods frequently large areas of the city. Indonesian authorities' highest priority is to reduce the flood problem but without a clear integrated rehabilitation strategy that accounts for water quality issues. Through field campaigns and model simulations we demonstrate how measures to solve the flood problem can further deplete water quality if the pollution load is not reduced. Results suggest that the current hydraulic river regime produces a benefit for the river health by increasing oxygen levels, natural degradation processes and dilution. A reduction in the average discharge by means of dam construction, as currently considered by the authorities, is likely to increase contamination levels of surface water and shallow aquifer, which is recharged by the river.},

abstract = {Anaerobic soil conditions resulting from flooding often enhance release of phosphorus (P) to overlying water. Enhanced P release is well documented for flooded acidic soils; however, there is little information for flooded alkaline soils. We examined the effect of flooding and anaerobic conditions on P mobilization using 12 alkaline soils from Manitoba that were either unamended or amended with solid cattle manure. Pore water and floodwater were analyzed over 8 wk of simulated flooding for dissolved reactive P (DRP), Ca, Mg, Fe, and Mn. As expected, manured soils had significantly greater pore and floodwater DRP concentrations than unamended. Flooding increased pore water DRP concentrations significantly in all soils and treatments except one manured clay in which concentrations increased initially and then decreased. Floodwater DRP concentrations increased significantly by two-to 15-fold in 10 soils regardless of amendment treatment but remained relatively stable in the two soils with greatest clay content. Phosphorus release at the onset of flooding was associated with the release of Ca, Mg, and Mn, suggesting that P release may be controlled by the dissolution of Mg and Ca phosphates and reductive dissolution of Mn phosphates. Thereafter, P release was associated with release of Fe, suggesting the reductive dissolution of Fe phosphates. Differences in pore water and floodwater DRP concentrations among soils and amendment treatments and the high variability in P mobilization from pore water to floodwater among soils indicate the need to further investigate chemical reactions responsible for P release and mobility under anaerobic conditions.},

abstract = {Though microbial activity is known to occur in frozen soils, little is known about the fate of animal manure N applied in the fall to agricultural soils located in areas with prolonged winter periods. Our objective was to examine transformations of soil and pig slurry N at low temperatures. Loamy and clay soils were either unamended (Control), amended with 15NH4-labeled pig slurry, or amended with the pig slurry and wheat straw. Soils were incubated at -6, -2, 2, 6, and 10 °C. The amounts of NH4, NO3 and microbial biomass N (MBN), and the presence of 15N in these pools were monitored. Total mineral N, NO3 and 15NO3 increased at temperature down to -2 °C in the loam soil and -6 °C in the clay soil, indicating that nitrification and mineralization proceeded in frozen soils. Nitrification and mineralization rates were 1.8-4.9 times higher in the clay than in the loamy soil, especially below freezing point (3.2-4.9), possibly because more unfrozen water remained in the clay than in the loamy soil. Slurry addition increased nitrification rates by 3-14 times at all temperatures, indicating that this process was N-limited even in frozen soils. Straw incorporation caused significant net N immobilization only at temperatures ≥2 °C in both soils; the rates were 1.4-3.4 higher in the loam than in the clay soil. Nevertheless, up to 30{\%} of the applied 15N was present in MBN at all temperatures. These findings indicate that microbial N immobilization occurred in frozen soils, but was not strong enough to induce net immobilization below the freezing point, even in the presence of straw. The Q10 values for estimated mineralization and nitrification rates were one to two orders-of-magnitude larger below 2 °C than above this temperature (13-208 versus 1.5-6.9, respectively), indicating that these processes are highly sensitive to a small increase in soil temperature around the freezing point of water. This study confirms that net mineralization and nitrification can occur at potentially significant rates in frozen agricultural soils, especially in the presence of organic amendments. In contrast, net N immobilization could be detected essentially above the freezing point. Our results imply that fall-applied N could be at risk of overwinter losses, particularly in fine-textured soils. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Climate warming in temperate regions may lead to decreased soil temperatures over winter as a result of reduced snow cover. We examined the effects of temperatures near the freezing point on N2O emissions, denitrification, and on the abundance and structure of soil nitrifiers and denitrifiers. Soil microcosms supplemented with NO3 and/or NO3 plus red clover residues were incubated for 120 days at −4 °C, −1 °C, +2 °C or +5 °C. Among microcosms amended with residues, N2O emission and/or denitrification increased with increasing temperature on Days 2 and 14. Interestingly, N2O emission and/or denitrification after Day 14 were the greatest at −1 °C. Substantial N2O emissions were only observed on Day 2 at +2 °C and +5 °C, while at −1 °C, N2O emissions were consistently detected over the duration of the experiment. Abundances of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), Nitrospira-like bacteria and nirK denitrifiers were the lowest in soils at −4 °C, while abundances of Nitrobacter-like bacteria and nirS denitrifiers did not vary among temperatures. Community structures of nirK and nirS denitrifiers and Nitrobacter-like bacteria shifted between below-zero and above-zero temperatures. Structure of AOA and AOB communities also changed but not systematically among frozen and unfrozen temperatures. Results indicated shifts in some nitrifier and denitrifier communities with freezing and a surprising stimulation of N2O emissions at −1 °C when NO3 and C are present.},

abstract = {Abstract Freshwater wetlands alter surface water quality in ways which benefit downstream use. This review summarizes the mechanisms of freshwater wetland interaction with sediment and nutrients that affect surface water quality. The mechanisms vary in magnitude and reversibility, and differ among wetland types. They include sedimentation, plant uptake, litter decomposition, retention in the soil, and microbial processes. Sedimentation is a relatively permanent retention mechanism whereby particulates and associated contaminants are physically deposited on the wetland soil surface. Plant uptake and litter decomposition provide short‐to long‐term retention of nutrients, depending on rates of leaching, translocation to and from storage structures, and the longevity of plant tissues. Plant litter can also provide a substrate for microbial processing of nutrients. Wetland soils sorb nutrients, and provide the environment for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms that process nutrients. Wetland storage compartm...},

abstract = {Hydrologic and hydrochemical studies have been conducted in Green Lakes Valley, Colorado Front Range, USA, above 3550 m since 1982. They show a classic seasonal hydrograph dominated by snowmelt and an earlier date for the start of spring flow and for peak flow over the period of record. This is consistent with patterns found at lower elevations in Colorado and throughout western North America. They also show an increasing trend in flows in September and October of 2.6±0.7 mm a–1 which is not found elsewhere and cannot be accounted for by increased autumn precipitation and the melting of surface ice. Because this late-season increase is not found at the highest elevations or in basins in which there is no evidence of permafrost, it seems best explained by the thawing of alpine permafrost at intermediate elevations. This is corroborated by an increase in the concentration of base cations and silica, and particularly in Ca2+ and SO4 –, in the stream discharge starting in 2000. As with the physical hydrology, the geochemical signals have not been detected at the higher elevations in the basin, though they have previously been associated with streamflow from a small rock glacier in the valley. The combined evidence suggests the degradation of ice-rich permafrost on the north-facing slopes of the valley below 3700 m, where it has been detected at 3 m depth by geophysical surveys.},

We examine the past 35 years (1981 to 2016) to explore monthly patterns over 36 locations and used some additional data to help interpret the changes. The analysis is at a finer spatial and temporal scale than previous studies that focused more on aggregate- or regional-scale changes. The trends in the first of the month{\&}rsquo;s snow water equivalent (SWE) varied more than the change in the monthly SWE, monthly precipitation or mean temperature. There was greater variability in SWE trends on the west side of the study area, and on average the declines in the west were greater. At higher elevations, there was more of a decline in the SWE. Changes in the climate were much less in winter than in summer. Per decade, the average decline in the winter precipitation was 4 mm and temperatures warmed by 0.29 {\&}deg;C, while the summer precipitation declined by 9 mm and temperatures rose by 0.66 {\&}deg;C. In general, November and March became warmer and drier, yielding a decline of the SWE on December 1st and April 1st, while December through February and May became wetter. February and May became cooler.},

The amount of soluble soil N accumulated was 48 ± 12 kg N ha−1 at one site, and 21 ± 6 kg N ha−1 at the other. In both cases, the overwinter accumulation approximately doubled the amount of soluble N in the soil. Similar trends were observed in both mineral and organic N, with 60 to 74{\%} of the accumulation occurring in the organic form. No clear correlations between soluble nitrogen dynamics and soil extractable organic carbon or soil microbial biomass carbon dynamics were observed. Denitrification apparently occurred in shallow soil during the thaw period at one site. Since soil nitrate levels decreased before significant thawing occurred, leaching was probably not the primary dissipation mechanism. We hypothesize that the soluble N accumulation was d...},

abstract = {To determine whether NO3− concentration pulses in surface water in early spring snowmelt discharge are due to atmospheric NO3−, we analyzed stream $\delta$15N-NO3− and $\delta$18O-NO3− values between February and June of 2001 and 2002 and compared them to those of throughfall, bulk precipitation, snow, and groundwater. Stream total Al, DOC and Si concentrations were used to indicate preferential water flow through the forest floor, mineral soil, and ground water. The study was conducted in a 135-ha subcatchment of the Arbutus Watershed in the Huntington Wildlife Forest in the Adirondack Region of New York State, U.S.A. Stream discharge in 2001 increased from 0.6 before to 32.4 mm day−1 during snowmelt, and element concentrations increased from 33 to 71 $\mu$mol L−1 for NO3−, 3 to 9 $\mu$mol L−1 for total Al, and 330 to 570 $\mu$mol L−1 for DOC. Discharge in 2002 was variable, with a maximum of 30 mm day−1 during snowmelt. The highest NO3−, Al, and DOC concentrations were 52, 10, and 630 $\mu$mol L−1, respectively, and dissolved Si decreased from 148 $\mu$mol L−1 before to 96 $\mu$mol L−1 during snowmelt. Values of $\delta$15N and $\delta$18O of NO3− in stream water were similar in both years. Stream water, atmospherically-derived solutions, and groundwaters had overlapping $\delta$15N-NO3− values. In stream and ground water, $\delta$18O-NO3− values ranged from +5.9 to +12.9‰ and were significantly lower than the +58.3 to +78.7‰ values in atmospheric solutions. Values of $\delta$18O-NO3− indicating nitrification, increase in Al and DOC, and decrease in dissolved Si concentrations indicating water flow through the soil suggested a dilution of groundwater NO3− by increasing contributions of forest floor and mineral soil NO3− during snowmelt.},

abstract = {In many regions, conservation tillage has replaced conventional tilling practices to reduce soil erosion, improve water conservation, and increase soil organic matter. However, tillage can have marked effects on soil properties, specifically nutrient redistribution or stratification in the soil profile. The objective of this research was to examine soil phosphorus (P) forms and concentrations in a long-term study comparing conservation tillage (direct drilling, “No Till”) and conventional tillage (moldboard plowing to 20 cm depth, “Till”) established on a fine sandy loam (Orthic Humo-Ferric Podzol) in Prince Edward Island, Canada. No significant differences in total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), total P, or total organic P concentrations were detected between the tillage systems at any depth in the 0- to 60-cm depth range analyzed. However, analysis with phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed differences in P forms in the plow layer. In particular, the concentration of orthophosphate was significantly higher under No Till than Till at 5 to 10 cm, but the reverse was true at 10 to 20 cm. Mehlich 3–extractable P was also significantly higher in No Till at 5 to 10 cm and significantly higher in Till at 20 to 30 cm. This P stratification appears to be caused by a lack of mixing of applied fertilizer in No Till because the same trends were observed for pH and Mehlich 3–extractable Ca (significantly higher in the Till treatment at 20 to 30 cm), reflecting mixing of applied lime. The P saturation ratio was significantly higher under No Till at 0 to 5 cm and exceeded the recommended limits, suggesting that P stratification under No Till had increased the potential for P loss in runoff from these sites.},

abstract = {The retention of agricultural P by 10-m wide grass buffers (GBZ) and buffers under natural vegetation (VBZ) was studied for 10 years in southwestern Finland. The results were compared with those from 70-m long plots without buffers (NBZ). The GBZs were mowed but the VBZs were not managed. Surface waters were directed into a collector trench on each plot. Soil samples were taken from the buffers to determine easily soluble P by a Finnish method (0.5 M NH4-acetate-0.5 M acetic acid, pH 4.6) and by the Olsen method. The highest losses of all P fractions were measured in spring, when the buffer vegetation had not yet started to grow. The mean annual total phosphorus (TP) loss from the GBZ and VBZ plots (0.7 kg ha-1) was 40{\%} lower than the TP loss from the NBZs (1.2 kg ha-1). However, the loss of molybdate-reactive P (RP) was 70{\%} higher from the VBZs than from the other plots. The concentration of Olsen-P was high (55.9 mg l-1) on the soil surface, 0-2 cm, in the VBZs. The high loss of RP from the VBZs was most likely due to P leaching from the soil surface and decaying grass residue on the VBZs in spring. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

As the flood peak was unpredicted by the flood forecast system, questions were raised concerning the causes and the predictability of the event. Here, we aimed to reconstruct the anatomy of this rain-on-snow flood in the L{\"{o}}tschen Valley (160 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) by analyzing meteorological data from the synoptic to the local scale and by reproducing the flood peak with the hydrological model WaSiM-ETH (Water Flow and Balance Simulation Model). This in order to gain process understanding and to evaluate the predictability. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} The atmospheric drivers of this rain-on-snow flood were (i) sustained snowfall followed by (ii) the passage of an atmospheric river bringing warm and moist air towards the Alps. As a result, intensive rainfall (average of 100 mm day{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) was accompanied by a temperature increase that shifted the 0° line from 1500 to 3200 m a.s.l. (meters above sea level) in 24 h with a maximum increase of 9 K in 9 h. The south-facing slope of the valley received significantly more precipitation than the north-facing slope, leading to flooding only in tributaries along the south-facing slope. We hypothesized that the reason for this very local rainfall distribution was a cavity circulation combined with a seeder-feeder-cloud system enhancing local rainfall and snowmelt along the south-facing slope. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} By applying and considerably recalibrating the standard hydrological model setup, we proved that both latent and sensible heat fluxes were needed to reconstruct the snow cover dynamic, and that locally high-precipitation sums (160 mm in 12 h) were required to produce the estimated flood peak. However, to reproduce the rapid runoff responses during the event, we conceptually represent likely lateral flow dynamics within the snow cover causing the model to react "oversensitively" to meltwater. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Driving the optimized model with COSMO (Consortium for Small-scale Modeling)-2 forecast data, we still failed to simulate the flood because COSMO-2 forecast data underestimated both the local precipitation peak and the temperature increase. Thus we conclude that this rain-on-snow flood was, in general, predictable, but requires a special hydrological model setup and extensive and locally precise meteorological input data. Although, this data quality may not be achieved with forecast data, an additional model with a specific rain-on-snow configuration can provide useful information when rain-on-snow events are likely to occur.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The forcing dataset includes daily precipitation, hourly air temperature, humidity, wind, solar and net radiation, soil temperature, and geographical information system data. The model performance assessment data include snow depth and snow water equivalent, streamflow, soil moisture, and water level in a groundwater well. This dataset was recorded at different elevation bands in Wolf Creek Research Basin, near Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada representing forest, shrub tundra, and alpine tundra biomes from 1993 through 2014.

@article{Hindshaw2011,
abstract = {The temporal and spatial controls of stream water chemistry in a small, granitic, glacial catchment were investigated in conjunction with high-resolution hydrological and meteorological measurements. Significant systematic seasonal and diurnal variations were observed in the stream water chemistry, which were not caused by the mixing of water draining different lithologies. A hydrological model (ALPINE3D, Lehning et al., 2006) was used to calculate the relative contributions of the principal water sources, snow melt and ice melt, throughout the period of this study. Pronounced seasonal minima in $\delta$18O and 87Sr/86Sr were attributed to spring snow melt. Clear changes in X/Si ratios (X=Ca, Mg, K, Na, Sr) between summer and winter were observed. These changes are interpreted to reflect seasonal changes in the average residence time of water in the sub-glacial drainage network with short residence times in summer, when the discharge was greatest, leading to high X/Si ratios, and long residence times in winter, when the discharge was lowest, resulting in low X/Si ratios. This study shows that the time dependent stoichiometry of cation to Si ratios in glacial stream water (and likely all catchments) strongly depends on the hydrological state of the catchment at the time of sampling. Annual fluxes based on spot samples varied by a factor of six depending on the time of year in which the sample was collected, highlighting the importance of long-term catchment monitoring. An improved understanding of the spatial and temporal controls acting on stream water chemistry will allow silicate weathering processes to be more precisely quantified.},

abstract = {Snow density is a fundamental physical property of snowpacks used in many aspects of snow research. As an integral component in the remote sensing of snow water equivalent and parameterisation of snow models, snow density may be used to describe many important features of snowpack behaviour. The present study draws on a significant dataset of snow density and climate observations from the United States, Australia and the former Soviet Union and uses regression-based techniques to identify the dominant climatological drivers for snow densification rates, characterise densification rate variability and estimate spring snow densities from more readily available climate data. Total winter precipitation was shown to be the most prominent driver of snow densification rates, with mean air temperature and melt-refreeze events also found to be locally significant. Densification rate variance is very high at Australian sites, very low throughout the former Soviet Union and between these extremes throughout much of the US. Spring snow densities were estimated using a statistical model with climate variable inputs and best results were achieved when snow types were treated differently. Given the importance of snow density information in many snow-related research disciplines, this work has implications for current methods of converting snow depths to snow water equivalent, the representation of snow dynamics in snow models and remote sensing applications globally. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The chemical changes in the submerged materials influence: (a) the character of the sediment or soil that forms, (b) the suitability of wet soils for crops, (c) the distribution of plant species around lakes and streams and in estuaries, deltas, and marine flood plains, (d) the quality and quantity of aquatic life, and (e) the capacity of lakes and seas to serve as sinks for terrestrial wastes. The single electrochemical property that serves to distinguish a submerged soil from a well-drained soil is its redox potential. The redox potential of a soil or sediment provides a quick, useful, semiquantitative measure of its oxidation–reduction status. Two recent developments have stimulated interest in the chemistry of submerged soils: the breeding of lowland rice varieties, with a high yield potential, and the pollution of streams, lakes, and seas, by domestic, agricultural, and industrial wastes. The chemistry of submerged soils is valuable: (a) in understanding the soil problems, limiting the performance of high-yielding rice varieties, and (b) in assessing the role of lake, estuarine, and ocean sediments as reservoirs of nutrients for aquatic plants and as sinks for terrestrial wastes. {\textcopyright} 1972, Academic Press Inc.},

abstract = {[1] Conventional thinking is that bacterial nitrification leading to labile nitrate in fertilized agricultural soils of northern regions greatly diminishes during winter. We have carried out seasonal water sampling over 2 years to understand the fate of nitrate present in a rapidly responding groundwater/ surface water system. Nitrate results show no seasonal delta N-15 trend. Significant delta O-18 downward shifts were observed between the spring-summer and autumn-winter periods of 2003 - 2004 (10.0{\%}) and 2004 - 2005 (1.3{\%}). Using mass-balance mixing calculations of soil leachate with groundwater and assuming seasonal nitrification, we reproduce the observed water and nitrate oxygen-isotope trends. These calculations suggest that nitrification takes place throughout all seasons. We also use a hydroclimatic index to establish a relationship between delta O-18 values in nitrate and recharge weighted by temperature. Our findings imply that nitrifying activities occur all year long and that winter nitrate production is high. This conclusion has important implications for modeling the nitrogen cycle of regions where seasonal changes in soil water mark the oxygen isotopes of nitrate.},

abstract = {The surface and outlets of two headwater lakes acidified during the 1978, 1979, and 1980 spring snowmelt periods. The decrease in pH was accompanied by an increase in nitrate whereas the other strong acid anion, SO42−, remained relatively constant. Chemical mass-balance calculations, using data from the Integrated Lake–Watershed Acidification Study, indicate that the peak in acidification observed in the Adirondack Mountains in the spring is caused by (1) a dilution of base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+) and associated alkalinity by snowmelt, (2) an increase in NO3− concentration in the acidified portion of the lakes, and (3) the constant elevated concentration of SO42−. At Woods Lake, the NO3− that accumulated in the snowpack plus that deposited from the atmosphere during snowmelt was sufficient to account for the increased NO3− in and transported from the lake. At Panther Lake, an additional source of NO3− was needed and was believed to be contributed by nitrification in the upper soil horizons. If atmospheric deposition of sulfur is reduced, low-alkalinity systems like Woods and moderate-alkalinity systems like Panther will be less likely to develop strong acidity during spring acidification.},

abstract = {Conventional chemical extraction methods to measure labile soil P are often inadequate for detecting fine temporal- and spatial-scale soil P dynamics in situ. We refined and calibrated methodology for anion-exchange resin-impregnated membranes (AEM), related AEM-P to soil solution P for a high-P-retaining soil, and evaluated the method's viability under humid tropical field conditions. We determined: (i) AEM recyclability, (ii) AEM P sorption kinetics, (iii) the correlation between soil solution P and AEM-P for an Andic Humitropept, and (iv) potential interference from other anions (NO−3 and SO2−4) on AEM P extraction. We used AEMs in a field decomposition study to evaluate plant residue and manure P release characteristics and concurrent fluxes in labile soil P. The AEM P sorption capacity was not altered significantly by repeated use. Nitrate solution concentrations in an aqueous medium of 50 and 100 mg NO3-N/L reduced AEM P sorption by 50 and 75{\%}, respectively, regardless of P solution concentration; SO4-S at 500 and 1000 mg/L reduced AEM P sorption by ≈98{\%}. The relationship between AEM-P and soil solution P was curvilinear at both nonequilibrium and equilibrium soil solution P concentrations; it was essentially linear at soil solution concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 mg P/L. The AEM behaved as a dynamic exchanger rather than an infinite sink for P, particularly in the context of a low-pH, high-P-retaining soil. The AEMs detected biologically relevant soil P pulses in the field decomposition study. The technique holds promise as an easy method for measuring soil P fluxes with minimal soil disturbance.},

abstract = {A new model has been developed for assessing the effects of multiple sources of phosphorus on the water quality and aquatic ecology in heterogeneous river systems. The Integrated Catchments model for Phosphorus (INCA-P) is a process-based, mass balance model that simulates the phosphorus dynamics in both the plant/soil system and the stream. The model simulates the spatial variations in phosphorus export from different land use types within a river system using a semi-distributed representation, thereby accounting for the impacts of different land management practices, such as organic and inorganic fertiliser and wastewater applications. The land phase of INCA-P includes a simplified representation of direct runoff, soilwater and groundwater flows, and the soil processes that involve phosphorus. In addition, the model includes a multi-reach in-stream component that routes water down the main river channel. It simulates Organic and Inorganic Phosphorus concentrations in the land phase, and Total Phosphorus (dissolved plus particulate phosphorus) concentrations in the in-stream phase. In-stream Soluble Reactive Phosphorus concentrations are determined from the Total Phosphorus concentrations and the macrophyte, epiphyte and algal biomasses are simulated also. This paper describes the model structure and equations, the limitations and the potential utility of the approach.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p style="line-height: 20px;"{\textgreater}{\textless}b{\textgreater}Keywords: {\textless}/b{\textgreater}modelling, water quality, phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, basin management{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was calibrated for a small watershed with extensive irrigation, low runoff, and a short (2004-2007) period of record in the semi-arid region of the Canadian prairies. The watershed is located on a segment of a river. The net flow between the upstream (inlet) and downstream (outlet) locations of the reach comprises only a fraction of the streamflow at the outlet. This type of watershed is rarely investigated and generally different from the "pear shaped" single outlet watersheds presented in SWAT literature. The objectives of this study were to determine if SWAT could be calibrated and validated on this unique watershed using one- and two-way calibration-validation methods, and to determine the effect of a variable climatic record on calibrated and validated parameters. To study the effect of a variable climatic record on the calibrated parameters for this watershed a two-way calibration verification scheme that involved two scenarios was used. Scenario 1 involved calibration using 2004 (average precipitation) and 2005 (above average precipitation) and validation on 2006 and 2007 (both below average precipitation). For scenario 2, the calibration and validation periods were reversed. A third scenario utilized the period of 2004-2006 for calibration and reserved the 2007 data for validation. The objective criteria used to evaluate model performance included decomposition of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) into systematic and unsystematic error, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (EF) and the coefficient of determination (R(2)) as model best fit objective functions. The calibration results were satisfactory for scenarios 1 and 3. The calibration of scenario 2 and the validation results for all three scenarios were unsatisfactory. The objective criteria calculated separately for each year in the calibration records showed the calibration results were satisfactory for 2005 only, which is the only wet year in the observed record with above average precipitation. Thus, calibrated parameters were mainly influenced by the 2005 wet season. Therefore, SWAT model calibration on a mixed record of wet and dry conditions will reflect the hydrological processes dominant during wet conditions rather than those observed during dry ones. Although we conclude that the SWAT model could not be successfully validated on this unique watershed, a longer record may result in successful calibration and validation.},

abstract = {In alpine and arctic ecosystems, the snowpack has been shown to insulate soils from the winter climatic harshness. Ongoing climate change modifies snowpack quantity and quality, but the consequences of these changes on the soil functioning remain largely unknown. We benefited from a subalpine landscape of the French Alps where, 700 years ago, agricultural practices led to the formation of terraces. Subsequently, on each terrace, snow thickness patterns significantly differed between the bank and the front areas inducing strong divergence in their soil microclimatic conditions. Using this framework, we measured abundances and activities of nitrifiers and denitrifiers, together with a set of environmental variables, on three grassland terraces between December and May to test the following hypotheses: (i) soil N-related microbial abundances and activities are sensitive to soil microclimatic variations and differ along the terrace snow depth gradient during winter, (ii) a thicker snowpack favors higher abundances and activities, and (iii) the driving forces for nitrification and denitrification abundances and activities vary along the snow depth gradient. Our results showed significantly and changing N-related microbial activities and abundances during winter despite partly frozen soils, and suggested the selection and/or adaptation of psychrophilic microbial communities. Moreover, activities as well as abundances of nitrifiers and denitrifiers were significantly higher under a weak or absent snowpack during winter, and mostly related to soil water content and soil surface temperature according to our models. We suggest that strongly variable soil abiotic conditions at the front stations enabled the release of nutrients from soil organic and inorganic compounds favoring psychrophilic bacterial abundances and activities. Contrastingly, a thicker and permanent snowpack maintained circum-zero soil temperatures during winter which limited the microbial community's turnover and release of organic and inorganic N. This created N-limited conditions and N-competition between microbial populations resulting in lower abundances and activities. Overall, changes in the snowpack depth strongly affect the soil microbial functioning of subalpine grasslands with potential consequences on nutrient dynamic and other trophic levels.},

abstract = {The Integrated Catchments model of Phosphorus dynamics (INCA-P) was applied to the River Lugg to determine the key factors controlling delivery of phosphorus to the main channel and to quantify the relative contribution of diffuse and point sources to the in-stream phosphorus (P) load under varying hydrological conditions. The model is able to simulate the seasonal variations and inter-annual variations in the in-stream total-phosphorus concentrations. However, difficulties in simulating diffuse inputs arise due to equifinality in the model structure and parameters. The River Lugg is split into upper and lower reaches. The upper reaches are dominated by grassland and woodland, so the patterns in the stream-water total-phosphorus concentrations are typical of diffuse source inputs; application of the model leads to estimates of the relative contribution to the in-stream P load from diffuse and point sources as 9:1. In the lower reaches, which are more intensively cultivated and urbanised, the stream-water total-phosphorus concentration dynamics are influenced more by point-sources; the simulated relative diffuse/point contribution to the in-stream P load is 1:1. The model set-up and simulations are used to identify the key source-areas of P in the catchment, the P contribution of the Lugg to the River Wye during years with contrasting precipitation inputs, and the uptake and release of P from within-reach sediment. In addition, model scenarios are run to identify the impacts of likely P reductions at sewage treatment works on the in-stream soluble-reactive P concentrations and the suitability of this as a management option is assessed for reducing eutrophication.

abstract = {No-tillage (NT), a practice that has been shown to increase carbon sequestration in soils, has resulted in contradictory effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Moreover, it is not clear how mitigation practices for N2O emission reduction, such as applying nitrogen (N) fertilizer according to soil N reserves and matching the time of application to crop uptake, interact with NT practices. N2O fluxes from two management systems [conventional (CP), and best management practices: NT + reduced fertilizer (BMP)] applied to a corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), winter-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation in Ontario, Canada, were measured from January 2000 to April 2005, using a micrometeorological method. The superimposition of interannual variability of weather and management resulted in mean monthly N2O fluxes ranging from − 1.9 to 61.3 g N ha−1 day−1. Mean annual N2O emissions over the 5-year period decreased significantly by 0.79 from 2.19 kg N ha−1 for CP to 1.41 kg N ha−1 for BMP. Growing season (May–October) N2O emissions were reduced on average by 0.16 kg N ha−1 (20{\%} of total reduction), and this decrease only occurred in the corn year of the rotation. Nongrowing season (November–April) emissions, comprised between 30{\%} and 90{\%} of the annual emissions, mostly due to increased N2O fluxes during soil thawing. These emissions were well correlated (r2= 0.90) to the accumulated degree-hours below 0 °C at 5 cm depth, a measure of duration and intensity of soil freezing. Soil management in BMP (NT) significantly reduced N2O emissions during thaw (80{\%} of total reduction) by reducing soil freezing due to the insulating effects of the larger snow cover plus corn and wheat residue during winter. In conclusion, significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions can be obtained when NT is combined with a strategy that matches N application rate and timing to crop needs.},

abstract = {Organic matter transformations take place in snow-covered soils during winter but in ways still poorly understood. Given the generally high soil water content and possible formation of ice layers during this period, anaerobic zones could develop and have determinant effects on soil C and N dynamics. The fate of C and N under wet and cold conditions was monitored in a sandy loam and a clay soil which were either unamended (control) or amended with cattle manure, pig slurry, maize or alfalfa residues. Soil samples were incubated for 84d during winter at constant water potential (−6kPa) in sealed containers laid on the floor of an unheated greenhouse. The containers were covered with fibre glass wool to simulate a snow cover. The O2, CO2 and N2O concentrations were periodically monitored in the headspace of the containers, whereas K2SO4-extractable C, KCl-extractable NO3− and NH4+, and volatile fatty acids were quantified in soil sub-samples. Despite the low soil temperature (average of 1°C), O2 consumption and CO2 production rates were significantly (P{\textless}0.05) increased by the amendments for the first 29d of incubation. After 29d, the O2 concentration fell below 6{\%} and CO2 production rate decreased in all amended soils. We assumed that after 29d aerobic respiration was replaced with fermentation processes in amended soils as indicated by respiratory quotients generally larger than 2, and by the progressive accumulation of volatile fatty acids. As O2 was consumed in sealed containers, nitrification decreased whereas ammonification continued and N2O production increased. As a result, soil NH4+ content increased whereas NO3− content was progressively depleted. After complete exhaustion of NO3−, the accumulated N2O disappeared and was probably reduced to N2. All measured parameters indicated that pig slurry and alfalfa stimulated soil microbial activities more than cattle manure and maize residues and these differences were partly related to the lignin-to-N ratio of the various amendments. Our data indicated that (i) significant C and N transformations occurred during winter in wet and cold soils amended with organic residues, (ii) under these conditions C and N dynamics were strongly influenced by O2 availability, and (iii) the rates at which C and N transformations occurred were partly determined by both C degradability and N availability of the organic amendments.},

This study evaluated the effect of freezing and thawing on the fate of P in bare soils, soils mixed with dairy manure, and soils with an established catch crop of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.). Experiments were conducted to evaluate changes in P runoff from packed soil boxes (100 by 20 by 5 cm) and P leaching from intact soil columns (30 cm deep). Before freezing and thawing, total P (TP) in runoff from catch-cropped soils was lower than from manured and bare soils due to lower erosion. Repeated freezing and thawing significantly increased water-extractable P (WEP) from catch crop biomass and resulted in significantly elevated concentrations of dissolved P in runoff (9.7 mg L(-1)) compared with manured (0.18 mg L(-1)) and bare soils (0.14 mg L(-1)). Catch crop WEP was strongly correlated with the number of freeze-thaw cycles. Freezing and thawing did not change the WEP of soils mixed with manures, nor were differences observed in subsurface losses of P between catch-cropped and bare soils before or after manure application. This study illustrates the trade-offs of establishing catch crops in frigid climates, which can enhance P uptake by biomass and reduce erosion potential but increase dissolved P runoff.},

abstract = {Canadian Shield catchments are under increasing pressure from various types of development (e.g., mining and increased cottagers) and changing climate. Within the southern part of the Canadian Shield, catchments are generally characterized by shallow forested soils with high infiltration rates and low bedrock infiltration, generating little overland flow, and macropore and subsurface flow are important streamflow generation processes. Large numbers of wetlands and lakes are also key physiographic features, and snow-processes are critical to catchment modeling in this climate. We have revised the existing, publicly available SWAT (version 2009.10.1 Beta 3) to create SWAT-CS, a version representing hydrological processes dominating Canadian Shield catchments, where forest extends over Precambrian Shield bedrock. Prior to this study, very few studies applying SWAT to Canadian Shield catchments exist (we have found three). We tested SWAT-CS using the Harp Lake catchment dataset, an Ontario Ministry of Environment research station located in south-central Ontario. Simulations were evaluated against 30years of observational data, including streamflow from six headwater sub-catchments (0.1–1.9km2), outflow from Harp Lake (5.4km2) and five years of weekly snow water equivalent (SWE). The best Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) results for daily streamflow calibration, daily streamflow validation, and SWE were 0.60, 0.65, and 0.87, respectively, for sub-catchment HP4 (with detailed land use and soil data). For this range of catchment scales, land cover and soil properties were found to be transferable across sub-catchments with similar physiographic features, namely streamflow from the remaining five sub-catchments could be modeled well using sub-catchment HP4 parameterization. The Harp Lake outflow was well modeled using the existing reservoir-based target release method, generating NSEs of 0.72 and 0.67 for calibration and verification periods respectively. With significant changes to the infiltration module (introducing macropore flow and reduced bedrock percolation), more than 90{\%} of interflow was generated close to the soil–bedrock interface and the contribution of groundwater flow to total runoff was reduced to small amounts, consistent with hydrological process understanding in this terrain. These two changes also allowed for a positive linear relationship between NSE of SWE and Q, whereas prior to these changes there was a negative relationship. With these key revisions to the infiltration and bedrock percolations modules, it is concluded that SWAT-CS can reasonably capture key hydrological processes within Canadian Shield catchments. Further testing will examine water quality modeling and larger-scale applications.},

This effect was established 1 day after the P was applied and persisted for 57 days. An increase in extraction temperature over the corresponding incubation temperature increased the extractability of P, indicating endothermic desorption reactions.

abstract = {Abstract Wetlands comprise 14{\%} of the land area of Canada. They have considerable impact on water storage and runoff, water quality, atmospheric exchanges of carbon, and important elements such as nitrogen. In less remote parts of Canada, wetlands have suffered from reclamation, exploitation, contamination and degradation, which have seriously impaired their ecological function. Public recognition of their environmental significance has highlighted the need for a better understanding of the hydrological processes, to better plan and manage wetland areas, restore degraded systems, and predict responses to global change. This paper reviews current hydrological research in all types of Canadian wetlands. The scope of hydrological processes discussed herein includes runoff, surface and groundwater flows, evaporation, microclimate, water balance, geochemical and solute transport phenomenon, carbon dynamics, isotope studies, exploitation and restoration. Field, laboratory and modelling studies are included. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The soil emission rates (fluxes) of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrogen oxides (NO + NO2 = NOx) through a seasonal snowpack were determined by a flux gradient method from near-continuous 2-year measurements using an automated system for sampling interstitial air at various heights within the snowpack from a subalpine site at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. The winter seasonal-averaged N2O fluxes of 0.047–0.069 nmol m−2 s−1 were {\~{}}15 times higher than observed NOx fluxes of 0.0030–0.0067 nmol m−2 s−1. During spring N2O emissions first peaked and then dropped sharply as the soil water content increased from the release of snowpack meltwater, while other gases, including NOx and CO2 did not show this behavior. To compare and contrast the winter fluxes with snow-free conditions, N2O fluxes were also measured at the same site in the summers of 2006 and 2007 using a closed soil chamber method. Summer N2O fluxes followed a decreasing trend during the dry-out period after snowmelt, interrupted by higher values related to precipitation events. These peaks were up to 2–3 times higher than the background summer levels. The integrated N2O-N loss over the summer period was calculated to be 1.1–2.4 kg N ha−1, compared to {\~{}}0.24–0.34 kg N ha−1 for the winter season. These wintertime N2O fluxes from subniveal soil are generally higher than the few previously published data. These results are of the same order of magnitude as data from more productive ecosystems such as fertilized grasslands and high-N-cycling forests, most likely because of a combination of the relatively well-developed soils and the fact that subnivean biogeochemical processes are promoted by the deep, insulating snowpack. Hence, microbially mediated oxidized nitrogen emissions occurring during the winter can be a significant part of the N-cycle in seasonally snow-covered subalpine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Many producers practice fall and winter manure spreading for economic and practical reasons. In order to minimize the risk of nitrogen (N) loss between application and crop uptake in the spring, university extension publications and industry professionals often make recommendations based on soil temperature. The objective of this research, there- fore, was to determine how soil temperature affects N losses in runoff and leachate, and assess overwinter N losses based on application date and soil temperature. Phosphorus losses are discussed in a separate article. Dairy manure was sur- face-applied to a channery silt loam soil contained in lysimeters at soil temperatures of 15.7°C, 4.8°C, and -1.1°C, which corresponded to early fall (Oct. 22), late fall (Nov. 17), and winter (Dec. 15) applications, respectively. Nitrogen losses were determined during a series of rainfall simulations and natural precipitation events from October 2009 through March 2010. The soil temperature between manure application and the first rainfall-runoff event three days after applica- tion was held constant and significantly influenced N loss. As the soil temperature decreased, losses of NH4-N, organic N, and total N exponentially increased. The form of N losses was also significantly impacted by application date and over- winter soil temperature. Early fall application of manure resulted in significant overwinter NO3-N losses, while the winter- applied manure had significantly more overwinter NH4-N losses. Results of this research show that there are trade-off risks associated with manure application in the fall and winter and that these trade-offs need to be considered in manure management planning in order to enhance N retention and help reduce the risk of overwinter N losses.},

abstract = {Concern over nonpoint source P losses from agricultural lands to surface waters in frigid climates has focused attention on the role of freezing and thawing on P loss from catch crops (cover crops). This study evaluated the effect of freezing and thawing on the fate of P in bare soils, soils mixed with dairy manure, and soils with an established catch crop of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.). Experiments were conducted to evaluate changes in P runoff from packed soil boxes (100 by 20 by 5 cm) and P leaching from intact soil columns (30 cm deep). Before freezing and thawing, total P (TP) in runoff from catch-cropped soils was lower than from manured and bare soils due to lower erosion. Repeated freezing and thawing significantly increased water-extractable P (WEP) from catch crop biomass and resulted in significantly elevated concentrations of dissolved P in runoff (9.7 mg L(-1)) compared with manured (0.18 mg L(-1)) and bare soils (0.14 mg L(-1)). Catch crop WEP was strongly correlated with the number of freeze-thaw cycles. Freezing and thawing did not change the WEP of soils mixed with manures, nor were differences observed in subsurface losses of P between catch-cropped and bare soils before or after manure application. This study illustrates the trade-offs of establishing catch crops in frigid climates, which can enhance P uptake by biomass and reduce erosion potential but increase dissolved P runoff.},

In Iceland the climate has become warmer and wetter with lengthening of the growing season and a corresponding increase in arable production. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of seasons and management practices on soil microbial biomass, nitrification, enzymatic activities and labile C availability. A parallel soil microcosms study was conducted to identify the key drivers in a controlled environment. Seasons had a more pronounced effect on soil microbial attributes (dehydrogenase activity, soil microbial biomass and labile C) than soil management with microbial attributes being greater in warmer summer months. This was an indication that continuing climate change and corresponding increase in dehydrogenase activity and soil microbial biomass in soils may increase carbon decomposition and hence loss of organic carbon from cultivated soils in Iceland. Management had a greater impact on soil N dynamics than seasons. There was evidence that precipitation promoted immobilisation of NO 3 --N in soils suggesting that the wetter climate developing in Iceland might reduce the availability of NO 3 --N to crops. Labile C was a governing factor in soil microbial activity as was demonstrated both in the field and the laboratory.},

In landscapes dominated by agriculture, P is primarily transported through non-point sources, which a number of best management practices aim to target. One such practice is vegetated buffer strips (VBS), which are designed to use dense vegetation above the surface and extensive root systems below the surface to reduce runoff velocity, trap sediments, increase infiltration, and increase plant uptake of nutrients. The effectiveness of VBS in reducing P concentrations has been studied and reviewed, but most studies have been undertaken in warm or temperate climates, where runoff is primarily driven through summer rainfall events and when vegetation is actively growing. In cold climates, the majority of runoff occurs during the snowmelt period, when soils are frozen and vegetation has been flattened by snow and ice ...},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the winter dynamics of SO4 2− and NO3 − in a forested soil to better understand controls on these acidifying anions during snowmelt. In February 2004, a stable isotopic tracer solution with 93 atom{\%} 34S as H2 34SO4 and 99 atom{\%} 15N as NH4 15NO3 was applied to the snowpack at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The chemical and isotopic compositions of throughfall, snow, snowmelt, and forest fl oor leachates were monitored for 10 mo following the addition of the tracers. The 34SO4 2− and 15NO3 − tracer amounts in forest fl oor leachates were high- est in the fi rst fractions of meltwater and declined exponentially until returning to ambient levels in mid-May. Isotopic mass balances indicated that SO4 2− and NO3 − were conserva- tive in the snowpack, with tracer recoveries near 100{\%}. In contrast, only 54 to 62{\%} of the 34SO4 2− and 49 to 58{\%} of the 15NO3 − were recovered in forest fl oor leachates, suggesting that much of the SO4 2− and NO3 − that infi ltrated the forest fl oor during snowmelt was retained or transformed. Microbial biomass $\delta$15N values in the forest fl oor remained low during snowmelt and the natural abundance values of $\delta$18O–NO3 − in forest fl oor leachates were indicative of an atmospheric rather than a microbial source. These results suggest that, in this study, microbial immobilization and subsequent mineralization and nitrifi cation of snowpack NO3 − was insignifi cant in the forest fl oor during snowmelt.},
